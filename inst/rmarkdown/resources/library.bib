  abstract = {Chromatin structure is epigenetically altered via covalent modifications of histones to allow for heritable gene regulation without altering the nucleotide sequence. Multiple lines of evidence from rodents have established a role for epigenetic remodeling in regulating gene transcription in response to an altered gestational milieu. However, to date, it is unknown whether variations in the intrauterine environment in primates similarly induce changes in key determinants of hepatic chromatin structure. We hypothesized that a maternal high-fat diet would alter the epigenomic profile of the developing offspring, which would result in alterations in fetal gene expression. Age- and weight-matched adult female Japanese macaques were placed on control (13\% fat) or high-fat (35\% fat) breeder diets and mated annually over a 4-year interval. Fetuses in successive years were delivered near term (e130 of 167 days) and underwent necropsy with tissue harvest. Fetal histones were acid extracted for characterization of H3 modification and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) with differential display PCR; fetal RNA, DNA, and cytoplasmic and nuclear protein extracts were similarly extracted for comparison. Chronic consumption of a maternal high-fat diet results in a threefold increase in fetal liver triglycerides and histologic correlates of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. These gross changes in the fetal liver are accompanied by a statistically significant hyperacetylation of fetal hepatic tissue at H3K14 (199.85{$\pm$}9.64 vs 88.8{$\pm$}45.4; P =0.038) with a trend towards the increased acetylation at H3K9 (140.9{$\pm$}38.7 vs 46.6{$\pm$}6.53; P =0.097) and at H3K18 (69.0{$\pm$}3.54 vs 58.0{$\pm$}4.04; P =0.096). However, epigenetic modifications on fetal hepatic H3 associated with gene repression were absent or subtle ( P {$>$}0.05). Subsequent characterization of key epigenetic determinants associated with H3 acetylation marks revealed similar significant alterations in association with a high-fat maternal diet (e.g., relative fetal histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) gene expression 0.61{$\pm$}0.25; P =0.011). Consistent with our mRNA expression profile, fetal nuclear extracts from offspring of high-fat diet animals were observed to be significantly relatively deplete of HDAC1 protein (36.07{$\pm$}6.73 vs 83.18{$\pm$}7.51; P =0.006) and in vitro HDAC functional activity (0.252{$\pm$}0.03 vs 0.698{$\pm$}0.02; P {$<$}0.001). We employ these observations in ChIP differential display PCR to attempt to identify potential fetal genes whose expression is reprogramed under conditions of a high-fat maternal diet. We quantitatively confirm a minimum of a 40\% alteration in the expression of several genes of interest: glutamic pyruvate transaminase (alanine aminotransferase) 2 ( GPT2 ) (1.59{$\pm$}0.23-fold; P =0.08), DNAJA2 (1.36{$\pm$}0.21; P =0.09), and Rdh12 (1.88{$\pm$}0.15; P =0.01) are appreciably increased in fetal hepatic tissue from maternal caloric-dense diet animals when compared with control while Npas2 , a peripheral circadian regulator, was significantly downmodulated in the offspring of high-fat diet animals (0.66{$\pm$}0.08; P =0.03). In this study, we show that a current significant in utero exposure (caloric-dense high-fat maternal diet) induces site-specific alterations in fetal hepatic H3 acetylation. Employing ChIP, we extend these observations to link modifications of H3 acetylation with alterations in gene-specific expression. These results suggest that a caloric-dense maternal diet leading to obesity epigenetically alters fetal chromatin structure in primates via covalent modifications of histones and hence lends a molecular basis to the fetal origins of adult disease hypothesis.},

The results of controlled studies have been contradictory, leading to confusion, and, possible, misinformation and misperception of teratogenic risk. Objective: To systematically review available data on pregnancy outcome when the mother consumed cocaine. Methods: A meta-analysis of all epidemiologic studies based on a priori criteria was conducted. Comparisons of adverse events in subgroups of exposed vs. unexposed children were performed. Analyses were based on several exposure groups: mainly cocaine, cocaine plus polydrug, polydrug but no cocaine, and drug free. Results: Thirty three studies met our inclusion criteria. For all end points of interest (rates of major malformations, low birth weight, prematurity, placental abruption, premature rupture of membrane [PROM], and mean birth weight, length and head circumference), cocaine-exposed infants had higher risks than children of women not exposed to any drug. However, most of these adverse effects were nullified when cocaine exposed children were compared to children exposed to polydrug but no cocaine. Only the risk of placental abruption and premature rupture of membranes were statistically associated with cocaine use itself. Conclusions: Many of the perinatal adverse effects commonly attributed to cocaine may be caused by the multiple confounders that can occur in a cocaine using mother. Only the risk for placental abruption and PROM could be statistically related to cocaine. For other adverse effects, additional studies will be needed to ensure adequate statistical power.},

Study design: We collected perinatal, neonatal, and infant follow-up data of 76 MC and 78 DC twins born between 24 and 34 weeks of gestation (295 infants). Risks of neuromorbidity in the surviving infants were evaluated in relation to chorionicity, discordant birth weight ({$>$}20\%), twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS), and cotwin death. Results: The overall incidence of cerebral palsy and minor neurologic disabilities in surviving twins was 4\% and 9\%, respectively. MC infants had a higher incidence of cerebral palsy (8\% vs 1\%, P{$<$}.05) and neurologic morbidity (15\% vs 3\%, P{$<$}.05) than DC infants. The risk of impaired neurodevelopment was higher in MC infants with discordant birth weight (42\%, P{$<$}.01), TTTS (37\%, P{$<$}.01), and cotwin death (60\%, P{$<$}.01) than those with concordant birth weight (8\%). In MC pregnancies, the cerebral palsy risk was higher in infants with discordant birth weight than those with chronic TTTS (19\% vs 4\%, P{$<$}.05). Similarly, discordant DC infants had higher neuromorbidity than concordant group (5\% vs. 1\%, P{$<$}.05). In both MC and DC discordant infants, neurologic morbidity was independent of growth restriction. Conclusion: Neurologic morbidity in the preterm MC infants was 7-fold higher than DC infants because of chronic TTTS, discordant birth weight, and cotwin death in utero. \textcopyright{} 2004 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The relationship between obesity and academic outcomes remains unclear. We evaluated the association between obesity and cognitive performance in US children. METHODS: We analyzed two nationally representative prospective cohorts of children in the 1979 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, ages 2 through 8 at baseline and followed for 6 years, from 1988 to 1994 (cohort 1, n=2672) and 1994 to 2000 (cohort 2, n=1991). The main exposure variable was obesity (defined as never obese, became obese, always obese, and became nonobese). The main outcomes were standardized scores on four cognitive assessments. Univariate regression analyses of test scores on obesity were performed. Fixed-effects regression models, controlling for measured and unmeasured time-invariant confounders, were additionally adjusted for time-variant confounders to analyze the impact of change in obesity status on change in test scores. RESULTS: Unadjusted analyses revealed a significant association between obesity and Peabody Individual Achievement Test (PIAT) scores. In cohort 1, always obese children had lower PIAT math scores than never obese children (beta=-7.48; p{$<$}0.05). Always obese boys had lower PIAT math scores than those who were never obese (beta=-16.45; p{$<$}0.01). In cohort 2, PIAT math scores were lower in the became obese category than the never obese category (beta=-4.10; p{$<$}0.05). Always obese girls had lower PIAT reading scores than those who were never obese (beta=-11.28; p{$<$}0.01). Fixed-effects models additionally adjusted for Home Observation Measurement of the Environment, Short Form score and height percentile showed no significant relationship between obesity and test scores in either cohort. CONCLUSION: Childhood obesity is unlikely to be causally related to cognitive performance.},

  abstract = {Children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have a higher rate of obesity than children without ADHD. Obesity risk alleles may overlap with those relevant for ADHD. We examined whether risk alleles for an increased body mass index (BMI) are associated with ADHD and related quantitative traits (inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity). We screened 32 obesity risk alleles of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for ADHD based on 495 patients and 1,300 population-based controls and performed in silico analyses of the SNPs in an ADHD meta-analysis comprising 2,064 trios, 896 independent cases, and 2,455 controls. In the German sample rs206936 in the NUDT3 gene (nudix; nucleoside diphosphate linked moiety X-type motif 3) was associated with ADHD risk (OR: 1.39; P\,=\,3.4\,\texttimes\,10(-4) ; Pcorr \,=\,0.01). In the meta-analysis data we found rs6497416 in the intronic region of the GPRC5B gene (G protein-coupled receptor, family C, group 5, member B; P\,=\,7.2\,\texttimes\,10(-4) ; Pcorr \,=\,0.02) as a risk allele for ADHD. GPRC5B belongs to the metabotropic glutamate receptor family, which has been implicated in the etiology of ADHD. In the German sample rs206936 (NUDT3) and rs10938397 in the glucosamine-6-phosphate deaminase 2 gene (GNPDA2) were associated with inattention, whereas markers in the mitogen-activated protein kinase 5 gene (MAP2K5) and in the cell adhesion molecule 2 gene (CADM2) were associated with hyperactivity. In the meta-analysis data, MAP2K5 was associated with inattention, GPRC5B with hyperactivity/impulsivity and inattention and CADM2 with hyperactivity/impulsivity. Our results justify further research on the elucidation of the common genetic background of ADHD and obesity.},

  abstract = {Summary The goal of mediation analysis is to assess direct and indirect effects of a treatment or exposure on an outcome. More generally, we may be interested in the context of a causal model as characterized by a directed acyclic graph (DAG), where mediation via a specific path from exposure to outcome may involve an arbitrary number of links (or "stages"). Methods for estimating mediation (or pathway) effects are available for a continuous outcome and a continuous mediator related via a linear model, while for a categorical outcome or categorical mediator, methods are usually limited to two-stage mediation. We present a method applicable to multiple stages of mediation and mixed variable types using generalized linear models. We define pathway effects using a potential outcomes framework and present a general formula that provides the effect of exposure through any specified pathway. Some pathway effects are nonidentifiable and their estimation requires an assumption regarding the correlation between counterfactuals. We provide a sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of this assumption. Confidence intervals for pathway effect estimates are obtained via a bootstrap method. The method is applied to a cohort study of dental caries in very low birth weight adolescents. A simulation study demonstrates low bias of pathway effect estimators and close-to-nominal coverage rates of confidence intervals. We also find low sensitivity to the counterfactual correlation in most scenarios.},

  abstract = {Recently, researchers have used a potential-outcome framework to estimate causally interpretable direct and indirect effects of an intervention or exposure on an outcome. One approach to causal-mediation analysis uses the so-called mediation formula to estimate the natural direct and indirect effects. This approach generalizes the classical mediation estimators and allows for arbitrary distributions for the outcome variable and mediator. A limitation of the standard (parametric) mediation formula approach is that it requires a specified mediator regression model and distribution; such a model may be difficult to construct and may not be of primary interest. To address this limitation, we propose a new method for causal-mediation analysis that uses the empirical distribution function, thereby avoiding parametric distribution assumptions for the mediator. To adjust for confounders of the exposure-mediator and exposure-outcome relationships, inverse-probability weighting is incorporated based on a supplementary model of the probability of exposure. This method, which yields the estimates of the natural direct and indirect effects for a specified reference group, is applied to data from a cohort study of dental caries in very-low-birth-weight adolescents to investigate the oral-hygiene index as a possible mediator. Simulation studies show low bias in the estimation of direct and indirect effects in a variety of distribution scenarios, whereas the standard mediation formula approach can be considerably biased when the distribution of the mediator is incorrectly specified.},

Singleton live births to U.S. resident mothers were selected. The analyses were limited to non-Hispanic American Indians, including Aleuts and Eskimos (n = 239,494), Non-Hispanic White (n = 15,488,133), and Hispanic births (n = 5,284,978).\textbackslash n\textbackslash nRESULTS: This comparison of birth characteristics and outcomes by ethnic group revealed that AIs have more adverse maternal risk factors (e.g., unmarried and {$<$}18 years of age) than Whites and Hispanics. After adjustment for these factors, AIs have higher risks of low birth weight and preterm birth and elevated risks of postneonatal and infant mortality. Their cause-specific rates for perinatal, SIDS, injury and infection are also higher. The regional analysis indicated the South/Northeast have more low birth weight and preterm problems, but the Mid-West has the highest risks of infant mortality among LBW infants gestational age-specific mortality rates, and mortality from SIDS.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSIONS: These data show that AIs are not a homogenous group as evinced by distinct regional differences. SIDS is mainly a problem in the Mid-West, suggesting the involvement of environmental factors in that region. Further investigation is needed to examine the current AI perinatal health concerns.},

This new ethnography of the Lakota Sioux (Standing Rock in North and South Dakota) examines patterns of alcohol consumption and strategies by individuals to attain a new lifestyle and achieve sobriety. Medicine describes how treatments are ineffective when researchers, policy makers, and health professionals do not use a tribal-specific approach to addiction. She offers an indigenous perspective and understanding that should lead to improved approaches to treatment in mental health and alcohol abuse.

RESULTS During the study period (1 January 1997 to 12 December 2015), there were 1\,158\,755 total discharges; 6023 (5.2/1000) had gastroschisis and 1885 (1.6/1000) had an omphalocele. Between 1997 and 2008, the reported rate of gastroschisis increased from 2.9 to 6.4/1000 discharges. From 2008 to 2011, the values have slowly decreased from 6.4 to 4.7/1000 discharges and since 2011 have been stable. The largest drop in the prevalence was in mothers who were {$<$}20 years old. In contrast, the reported rate of omphalocele was stable at 1 to 2/1000 discharges. CONCLUSION The prevalence of gastroschisis increased from 1997 to 2008, and then declined thereafter.},

Knowledge of future neurodevelopmental delay in children born with various degrees of prematurity is needed to inform practice and policy. Objective: To quantify the long-term cognitive, motor, behavioural and academic performance of children born with different degrees of prematurity compared with term-born children. Search strategy: PubMed and Embase were searched from January 1980 to December 2016 without language restrictions. Selection criteria: Observational studies that reported neurodevelopmental outcomes from 2 years of age in children born preterm compared with a term-born cohort. Data collection and analysis: We pooled individual estimates of standardised mean differences (SMD) and odds ratios (OR) with 95\% confidence intervals using a random effects model. Main results: We included 74 studies (64 061 children). Preterm children had lower cognitive scores for FSIQ (SMD: -0.70; 95\% CI: -0.73 to -0.66), PIQ (SMD: -0.67; 95\% CI: -0.73 to -0.60) and VIQ (SMD: -0.53; 95\% CI: -0.60 to -0.47). Lower scores for preterm children in motor skills, behaviour, reading, mathematics and spelling were observed at primary school age, and this persisted to secondary school age, except for mathematics. Gestational age at birth accounted for 38\textendash 48\% of the observed IQ variance. ADHD was diagnosed twice as often in preterm children (OR: 1.6; 95\% CI: 1.3\textendash 1.8), with a differential effect observed according to the severity of prematurity (I 2 = 49.4\%, P = 0.03). Conclusions: Prematurity of any degree affects the cognitive performance of children born preterm. The poor neurodevelopment persists at various ages of follow up. Parents, educators, healthcare professionals and policy makers need to take into account the additional academic, emotional and behavioural needs of these children.

We also propose an informal way to assess selectivity bias based on measuring the ratio of selection on unobservables to selection on observables that would be required if one is to attribute the entire effect of Catholic school attendance to selection bias. We use our methods to estimate the effect of attending a Catholic high school on a variety of outcomes. Our main conclusion is that Catholic high schools substantially increase the probability of graduating from high school and, more tentatively, attending college.

  abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Childhood cancer is a leading cause of mortality among children and adolescents in the developed world and the incidence increases by 0.9\% each year. Leukemia accounts for about 30\% of all childhood cancer but its etiology is still mostly unknown. OBJECTIVE: To conduct a meta-analysis of available scientific evidence on the association between breastfeeding and childhood leukemia. DATA SOURCES: A thorough search for articles published between January 1960 and December 2014 researching the association between breastfeeding and childhood leukemia was conducted on PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and Scopus (performed in July and December 2014), supplemented by manual searches of reference lists. STUDY SELECTION: To be included in the meta-analyses, studies had to be case control; include breastfeeding as a measured exposure and leukemia as a measured outcome; include data on breastfeeding duration in months; and be published in a peer-reviewed journal with full text available in English. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: The search identified 25 relevant studies, 18 of which met all inclusion criteria. No publication bias or heterogeneity among these 18 studies were detected. The quality of each study that met the inclusion criteria was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Multiple meta-analyses were conducted using the random effect model on raw data in the StatsDirect statistical program. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: No or short duration of breastfeeding and the incidence of childhood leukemia. RESULTS: The meta-analysis of all 18 studies indicated that compared with no or shorter breastfeeding, any breastfeeding for 6 months or longer was associated with a 19\% lower risk for childhood leukemia (odds ratio, 0.81; 95\% CI, 0.73-0.89). A separate meta-analysis of 15 studies indicated that ever breastfed compared with never breastfed was associated with an 11\% lower risk for childhood leukemia (odds ratio, 0.89; 95\% CI, 0.84-0.94), although the definition of never breastfed differed between studies. All meta-analyses of subgroups of the 18 studies showed similar associations. Based on current meta-analyses results, 14\% to 19\% of all childhood leukemia cases may be prevented by breastfeeding for 6 months or more. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Breastfeeding is a highly accessible, low-cost public health measure. This meta-analysis that included studies not featured in previous meta-analyses on the subject indicates that promoting breastfeeding for 6 months or more may help lower childhood leukemia incidence, in addition to its other health benefits for children and mothers.},

We examine whether air pollution exposures immediately preceding delivery are associated with acute-onset abruptions. METHODS: We applied a bidirectional, time-stratified, case-crossover design to births with an abruption diagnosis in New York City, 2008-2014. We measured ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). We fit distributed lag nonlinear models based on conditional logistic regression to evaluate individual exposure and cumulative exposures over lags 0-7 days before abruption, adjusted for temperature and relative humidity (similar lags to the main exposures). RESULTS: We identified 1,190 abruption cases. We observed increased odds of abruption for exposure to PM2.5 (per 10 {$\mu$}g/m) on lag day 3 (odds ratio [OR] 1.19, 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 0.98, 1.43), lag day 4 (OR 1.21, 95\% CI = 1.01, 1.46), and lag day 5 (OR 1.17, 95\% CI = 1.03, 1.33). Similarly, the odds of abruption increased with exposure to NO2 (per 5 ppb) on lag day 3 (OR 1.16, 95\% CI = 0.98, 1.37), lag day 4 (OR 1.19, 95\% CI = 1.02, 1.39), and lag day 5 (OR 1.16, 95\% CI = 1.05, 1.27). Exposures to PM2.5 and NO2 at other lags, or cumulative exposures, were not associated with abruption of acute onset. CONCLUSIONS: This case-crossover study showed evidence of an association between short-term ambient air pollution exposures and increased abruption risk of acute onset.},

  abstract = {Causal mediation analysis is a useful tool for epidemiological research, but it has been criticized for relying on a "cross-world" independence assumption that is empirically difficult to verify and problematic to justify based on background knowledge. In the present article we aim to assist the applied researcher in understanding this assumption. Synthesizing what is known about the cross-world independence assumption, we discuss the relationship between assumptions for causal mediation analyses, causal models, and non-parametric identification of natural direct and indirect effects. In particular we give a practical example of an applied setting where the cross-world independence assumption is violated even without any post-treatment confounding. Further, we review possible alternatives to the cross-world independence assumption, including the use of computation of bounds that avoid the assumption altogether. Finally, we carry out a numerical study in which the cross-world independence assumption is violated to assess the ensuing bias in estimating natural direct and indirect effects. We conclude with recommendations for carrying out causal mediation analyses.},

  abstract = {Objective: To describe metastasis-free survival (MFS) in men with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) recurrence following radical prostatectomy, and to define clinical prognostic factors modifying metastatic risk. Patients and Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 450 men treated with prostatectomy at a tertiary hospital between July 1981 and July 2010 who developed PSA recurrence ({$\geq$}0.2 ng/mL) and never received adjuvant or salvage therapy before the development of metastatic disease. We estimated MFS using the Kaplan-Meier method, and investigated factors influencing the risk of metastasis using Cox proportional hazards regression. Results: Median follow-up after prostatectomy was 8.0 years, and after biochemical recurrence was 4.0 years. At last follow-up, 134 of 450 patients (29.8\%) had developed metastases, while median MFS was 10.0 years. Using multivariable regressions, two variables emerged as independently predictive of MFS: PSA doubling time ({$<$}3.0 vs 3.0-8.9 vs 9.0-14.9 vs {$\geq$}15.0 months) and Gleason score ({$\leq$}6 vs 7 vs 8-10). Using these stratifications of Gleason score and PSA doubling time, tables were constructed to predict median, 5- and 10-year MFS after PSA recurrence. In different patient subsets, median MFS ranged from 1 to 15 years. Conclusions: In men undergoing prostatectomy, MFS after PSA recurrence is variable and is most strongly influenced by PSA doubling time and Gleason score. These parameters serve to stratify men into different risk groups with respect to metastatic progression. Our findings may provide the background for appropriate selection of patients, treatments and endpoints for clinical trials. \textcopyright{} 2011 The Authors.},

MNR induced major cerebral developmental disturbances without fetal growth restriction or marked maternal weight reduction. Mechanisms evaluated included neurotrophic factor suppression, cell proliferation and cell death imbalance, impaired glial maturation and neuronal process formation, down-regulation of gene ontological pathways and related gene products, and up-regulated transcription of cerebral catabolism. Contrary to the known benefits from this degree of dietary reduction on life span, MNR in pregnancy compromises structural fetal cerebral development, potentially having an impact on brain function throughout life.},

METHODS: Records of workers between 1950 and 1982 were obtained from a medical surveillance programme. Proportional hazards models were used to model the association between silica exposure and lung cancer mortality, with penalised splines used to smooth the exposure-response relationship. A sensitivity analysis compared results between the original cohort and subcohorts defined by restricting date of hire to include varying proportions of prevalent hires. RESULTS: Restricting to incident hires reduced the 213 cases by 74\% and decreased the exposure range. The maximum mortality rate ratio (MRR) was close to twofold in all subcohorts. However, the exposure at which the maximum MRR was achieved decreased from 4.0 to 0.6 mg-year/m3 as the proportion of prevalent hires decreased from 50\% in the original cohort to 0\% in the subcohort of incident hires. CONCLUSION: Despite loss in power and restricted exposure range, decreasing the relative proportion of prevalent to incident hires reduced HWSE bias, resulting in stronger evidence for a dose-response between silica exposure and lung cancer mortality.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Occupational exposure to endotoxin, found in Gram-negative bacteria in organic material, has been associated predominantly with a reduced risk of lung cancer among workers. An inverse exposure-response gradient among women textile workers in Shanghai, China, has been reported previously. In this case-cohort study, we investigated the influence of left truncation, which can itself induce a downward trend, on the observed association. METHODS: Subjects were enrolled between 1989 and 1991 and followed until 1998. The data were left-truncated as all subjects were hired before baseline. An analysis was performed with 3038 subcohort members and 602 cases of incident lung cancer. To evaluate left truncation, we compared lung cancer rates in those hired longer ago with those hired more recently among unexposed subjects. Cox proportional hazards modelling was used to estimate incident rate ratios (IRRs) and 95\% CIs. RESULTS: Among those who were never exposed to workplace endotoxin, we compared lung cancer rates in those hired {$>$}35 years before enrolment with workers hired {$\leq$}35 years before enrolment and observed a reduced risk in the former group, IRR=0.74, 95\% CI (0.51 to 1.07). After accounting for this downward bias from left truncation, the reduced risk associated with endotoxin remained among those hired {$\leq$}50 years before enrolment. In contrast, there was suggestion of an increased risk of lung cancer among those hired {$>$}50 years ago. CONCLUSIONS: After examination of left truncation bias, an inverse dose-response between endotoxin and lung cancer remained for all subjects except those hired longest ago.},

We compared 101 children exposed prenatally to cocaine with 130 unexposed children on measures of intelligence, visual motor, and motor abilities at age 7 years. Bivariate analyses revealed that cocaine-exposed children scored significantly lower than comparison children on the abbreviated Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Third Edition Verbal and Full Scale IQ scores, the Visual Motor Integration and Motor Coordination standardized scores, and the Bruininks-Oseretsky Fine Motor Composite score. Regression analyses indicated that the biological mother's vocabulary and home environment assessed at the same 7-year visit were stronger predictors of developmental outcome than prenatal drug exposure. Level of cocaine exposure, however, predicted visual motor and motor skills. The results indicate that although prenatal cocaine exposure may confer some degree of developmental disadvantage in the visual motor domain, it frequently occurs in the context of an inadequate rearing environment, which may be a stronger determinant than prenatal cocaine exposure of children's outcome.},

This perspective suggests a generalization with two way (both unit and time) fixed effects, and both unit and time weights, which can be interpreted as a unit and time weighted version of the standard Difference In Differences (DID) estimator. We find that this new Synthetic Difference In Differences (SDID) estimator has attractive properties compared to the SC and DID estimators. Formally we show that our approach has double robustness properties: the SDID estimator is consistent under a wide variety of weighting schemes given a well-specified fixed effects model, and SDID is consistent with appropriately penalized SC weights when the basic fixed effects model is misspecified and instead the true data generating process involves a more general low-rank structure (e.g., a latent factor model). We also present results that justify standard inference based on weighted DID regression. Further generalizations include unit and time weighted factor models.},

In this paper, we demonstrate that, as concern about this social problem escalated beyond the level warranted by the existing evidence, FAS took on the status of a moral panic. Through examples taken from both the biomedical literature and the media about drinking during pregnancy, we illustrate the evolution of this development, and we describe its implications, particularly how it has contributed to a vapid public policy response.},

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Mothers' and teachers' reports of children's internalizing problems at 7 and 10 years of age. RESULTS: Monozygotic twins who had been bullied had more internalizing symptoms (mean, 0.23; SD, 1.00) compared with their co-twin who had not been bullied (mean, -0.13; SD, 0.86), indicating that being bullied has an environmentally mediated effect on children's internalizing problems (beta, 0.36 [95\% confidence interval (CI), 0.18-0.54]).

These associations call into question the recently released Institute of Medicine (IOM) gestational weight gain recommendations, particularly for obese women. The IOM recommendation of a single standard of weight gain for all obesity classes is also of concern, because higher body mass index levels are associated with more severe pregnancy complications, such as preeclampsia and gestational diabetes. The IOM recommendations retained the 1990 focus on the theoretical association between poor gestational weight gain and low birth weight (LBW). Low gestational weight gain may often be a consequence and not the cause of LBW, and there is a lack of evidence in developed countries that dietary supplementation increases birth weight. Current obstetric practice allows for accurate and timely diagnosis of and intervention for LBW. We submit that gestational weight gain recommendations should be more individualized especially for obese women. Obese pregnant women should not be precluded from partaking in healthy lifestyle modifications in pregnancy that include physical activities, modified, judicious diets, and limited weight gain.},

  abstract = {How to manage patients with prostate cancer (PCa) with biochemical recurrence (BCR) following primary curative treatment is a controversial issue. Importantly, this prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-only recurrence is a surrogate neither of PCa-specific survival nor of overall survival. Physicians are therefore challenged with preventing or delaying the onset of clinical progression in those deemed at risk, while avoiding over-treating patients whose disease may never progress beyond PSA-only recurrence. Adjuvant therapy for radical prostatectomy (RP) or local radiotherapy (RT) has a role in certain at-risk patients, although it is not recommended in low-risk PCa owing to the significant side-effects associated with RT and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). The recommendations for salvage therapy differ depending on whether BCR occurs after RP or primary RT, and in either case, definitive evidence regarding the best strategy is lacking. Options for treatment of BCR after RP are RT at least to the prostatic bed, complete or intermittent ADT, or observation; for BCR after RT, salvage RP, cryotherapy, complete or intermittent ADT, brachytherapy, high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), or observation can be considered. Many patient- and cancer-specific factors need to be taken into account when deciding on the best strategy, and optimal management depends on the involvement of a multidisciplinary team, consultation with the patient themselves, and the adoption of an individualised approach. Improvements in imaging techniques may enable earlier detection of metastases, which will hopefully refine future management decisions.},

As with previous research some of these nonshared environmental (NSE) relationships appeared to operate partly as a function of SES, family chaos and maternal depression. Higher-risk families generally showed stronger negative associations.},

  abstract = {Purpose This study examined the lifestyle and clinical risk factors for lymphedema in a cohort of patients who underwent bilateral breast cancer surgery. Patients and Methods Between 2013 and 2016, 327 patients who underwent bilateral breast cancer surgery were prospectively screened for arm lymphedema as quantified by the weight-adjusted volume change (WAC) formula. Arm perometry and subjective data were collected preoperatively and at regular intervals postoperatively. At the time of each measurement, patients completed a risk assessment survey that reported the number of blood draws, injections, blood pressure readings, trauma to the at-risk arm, and number of flights since the previous measurement. Generalized estimating equations were applied to ascertain the association among arm volume changes, clinical factors, and risk exposures. Results The cohort comprised 327 patients and 654 at-risk arms, with a median postoperative follow-up that ranged from 6.1 to 68.2 months. Of the 654 arms, 83 developed lymphedema, defined as a WAC \$ 10\% relative to baseline. On multivariable analysis, none of the lifestyle risk factors examined through the risk assessment survey were significantly associated with increased WAC. Multivariable analysis demonstrated that having a body mass index \$ 25 kg/m2 at the time of breast cancer diagnosis (P = .0404), having undergone axillary lymph node dissection (P = .0464), and receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy (P = .0161) were significantly associated with increased arm volume. Conclusion Blood pressure readings, blood draws, injections, and number or duration of flights were not significantly associated with increases in arm volume in this cohort. These findings may help to guide patient education about lymphedema risk reduction strategies for those who undergo bilateral breast cancer surgery.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Information is needed to understand the role of low to moderate levels of mothers' emotional stress and child characteristics (i.e. prematurity) on parenting behaviours and their impact on children's behaviour that might be deemed 'challenging' but not 'disordered'. METHODS: The direct and indirect relations of maternal childrearing history and emotional stress, and observed parenting practices when children were 3 years of age on 4-year child behavioural outcomes was examined in a sample of low-income families with a term (n=112) or preterm (n=180) child. Parenting practices included displays of warmth and restrictiveness when interacting with their children. Child outcomes at 4 years included observation of social initiations with their mothers and maternal report of social and attentional problems. RESULTS: A Structural Equation Model building approach guided by specific hypotheses indicated that preterm as compared to full-term children had more maternal reported social and attentional problems but did not differ in observed social initiating skills. Greater negative maternal childrearing history indirectly influenced social initiating skills through its direct influence on maternal emotional stress. Greater maternal emotional stress directly influenced mothers' parenting that, in turn, directly influenced social initiating. Prematurity and a more negative childrearing history had a direct negative influence on the maternal report of social and attentional behavioural outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: These findings delineate the effects of prematurity and maternal parenting on the behaviour of 4-year-old-children and extend current knowledge of the influence of parental emotional stress on parenting. Even milder levels can negatively influence parenting, and in turn, contribute to children's less well developed social skills. The issues raised in this study could help with the identification and prioritization of medical and psychological services.},

  abstract = {A 5-year, fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) primary prevention study was conducted in Washington State to: (1) assess the feasibility of using a FAS diagnostic and prevention clinic as a centre for identifying and targeting primary prevention intervention to high-risk women (namely women who had given birth to a child with FAS); (2) generate a comprehensive, lifetime profile of these women; (3) identify factors that have enhanced and/or hindered their ability to achieve abstinence. The results of this study are presented in two parts: work on objective 1 is summarized in the present paper; whereas that on objectives 2 and 3 is summarized in the accompanying paper. This project demonstrated that a multidisciplinary FAS Diagnostic and Prevention Network (FAS DPN) clinic could successfully attract and meet the diagnostic and treatment planning needs of patients presenting with prenatal alcohol exposure. One out of every three patients evaluated in the FAS DPN clinics was diagnosed with FAS or static encephalopathy/alcohol exposed. The birth mothers of one out of every three of these children diagnosed with FAS or static encephalopathy/alcohol exposed could be located and directly contacted. Half of the birth mothers directly contacted were still at risk for producing more children damaged by prenatal alcohol exposure. Thus, one out of every 18 children evaluated in the FAS DPN clinics had a birth mother who could be found and was at risk of producing more children damaged by prenatal alcohol exposure. Primary prevention programmes targeted to this high-risk population could lead to measurable, cost-effective reductions in the incidence of FAS. Using this approach, the cost of raising a child with FAS would be roughly 30 times the cost of preventing FAS in the child. The benefit to the children, their mothers, and society would be immeasurable.},

It is characterised by growth deficiency, central nervous system damage/dysfunction, and a unique cluster of minor facial anomalies. To assess the effectiveness of fetal alcohol syndrome prevention efforts, one must be able to estimate accurately the prevalence of fetal alcohol syndrome over time in population-based samples. With the establishment of the Washington State Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Diagnostic and Prevention Network of clinics, the development of the Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Facial Photographic Analysis Software, the creation of the Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) 4-Digit Diagnostic Code, the establishment of the Foster Care Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Screening Program, and the collection of Pregnancy Risk Assessment Management System data on maternal use of alcohol during pregnancy, the tools, methods and infrastructure for assessing the effectiveness of fetal alcohol syndrome primary prevention efforts in Washington State are in place. A cross-sectional study was conducted to determine whether the prevalence of fetal alcohol syndrome among children in a foster care population, born between 1993 and 1998, decreased with the documented decrease in prevalence of maternal use of alcohol during pregnancy from 1993 and 1998 in Washington State.

Depressive symptoms may be more common among the obese individuals who perceive themselves as overweight, rather than those who perceive themselves as having an acceptable weight. Our aim was to determine whether weight status and weight perceptions are independently associated with psychological distress. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study using data from the Australian National Health Survey 2004-2005 (N=17 253). All variables were collected by self-report. Adjusted multinomial logistic regression analysis was conducted to generate prevalence odds ratios with 95\% confidence intervals (95\% CI) for medium (Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10) scores of 20-29) and high (K10 scores of 30-50) psychological distress (compared with K10 scores of 10-19 as the reference) associated with weight status (standard body mass index (BMI) cutoffs for underweight, overweight and obesity vs normal weight), weight perception (perceived underweight and overweight vs acceptable weight) and weight misperception (incorrect with BMI vs correct with BMI) adjusting for numerous important covariates. RESULTS: Overweight and underweight perception increased the odds of medium (40 and 50\%) and high (50 and 120\%) psychological distress, whereas weight status and weight misperception were not associated with psychological distress in adjusted analysis. Gender, alcohol consumed per week and post-school education were not significant covariates (at P{$<$}0.10 level). CONCLUSIONS: Overweight and underweight perception rather than weight status or weight misperception are significant risk factors associated with medium and high psychological distress prevalence and effects appear to be uniform for men and women. Well-designed prospective studies are still needed to determine whether weight perceptions cause psychological distress, and if so, whether symptoms are significantly reduced following effective intervention.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although aggregate data suggest a link between snowfall and myocardial infarction (MI), individual risk has yet to be assessed. We evaluated the association between quantity and duration of snowfall and the risk of MI using nonag-gregated administrative health data. METHODS: We used a case-crossover study design to investigate the association between snowfall and hospital admission or death due to MI in the province of Quebec, Canada, between November and April during 1981-2014. The main exposure measures were quantity (in centimetres) and duration (in hours) of snowfall by calendar day. We computed odds ratios (ORs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between daily snowfall and MI, adjusted for minimum daily temperatures. RESULTS: In all, 128073 individual hospital admissions and 68 155 deaths due to MI were included in the analyses. The likelihood of MI was increased the day after a snowfall among men but not among women. Compared with 0 cm, 20 cm of snowfall was associated with an OR of 1.16 for hospital admission (95\% CI 1.11-1.21) and 1.34 for death (95\% CI 1.26-1.42) due to MI the following day among men. Corresponding ORs among women were 1.01 (95\% CI 0.95-1.07) and 1.04 (95\% CI 0.96-1.13). Similar but smaller associations were observed for snowfall duration (0 h v. 24 h) and MI. INTERPRETATION: Both the quantity and duration of snowfall were associated with subsequent risk of hospital admission or death due to MI, driven primarily by an effect in men. These data have implications for public health initiatives in regions with snowstorms.},

Consistent patterns of participation associated with risk factors and diseases under study were found. A simple error term was developed to convert the odds ratio for respondents to the odds ratio for the target population using individual cell response rates. This error term demonstrates that the response patterns found tended to minimize the error in odds ratio calculations for respondents. Only by obtaining relevant information on non-respondents can investigators accurately estimate response bias and its effects on the odds ratio. \textcopyright{} 1981 by The Johns Hopkins University School of Hygiene and Public Health.},

  abstract = {Increasingly, clinical research is evaluated on the quality of its statistical analysis. Traditionally, statistical analyses in clinical research have been carried out from a `frequentist' perspective.The presence of an alternative paradigm \textendash{} the Bayesian paradigm \textendash{} has been relatively unknown in clini- cal research until recently. There is currently a growing interest in the use of Bayesian statistics in health care research.This is due both to a growing realization of the limitations of frequentist methods and to the ability of Bayesian methods explicitly to incorporate prior expert knowledge and belief into the analyses. This is in contrast to frequentist methods, where prior experience and beliefs tend to be incorporated into the analyses in an ad hoc fashion.This paper outlines the frequentist and Bayesian paradigms. Acute myocardial infarction mortality data are then analysed from both a Bayesian and a frequentist perspective. In some analyses, the two methods are seen to produce comparable results; in others, they produce different results. It is noted that in this example, there are clinically relevant ques- tions that are more easily addressed from a Bayesian perspective. Finally, areas in clinical research where Bayesian ideas are increasingly common are highlighted},

We used Monte Carlo simulations to examine the following algorithms for forming matched pairs of treated and untreated subjects: optimal matching, greedy nearest neighbor matching without replacement, and greedy nearest neighbor matching without replacement within specified caliper widths. For each of the latter two algorithms, we examined four different sub-algorithms defined by the order in which treated subjects were selected for matching to an untreated subject: lowest to highest propensity score, highest to lowest propensity score, best match first, and random order. We also examined matching with replacement. We found that (i) nearest neighbor matching induced the same balance in baseline covariates as did optimal matching; (ii) when at least some of the covariates were continuous, caliper matching tended to induce balance on baseline covariates that was at least as good as the other algorithms; (iii) caliper matching tended to result in estimates of treatment effect with less bias compared with optimal and nearest neighbor matching; (iv) optimal and nearest neighbor matching resulted in estimates of treatment effect with negligibly less variability than did caliper matching; (v) caliper matching had amongst the best performance when assessed using mean squared error; (vi) the order in which treated subjects were selected for matching had at most a modest effect on estimation; and (vii) matching with replacement did not have superior performance compared with caliper matching without replacement.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Research on alcohol consumption during pregnancy and miscarriage spans over three decades, yet the relationship is still not well-understood. OBJECTIVES: To assess the relationship between volume and type of alcohol consumed during pregnancy in relation to miscarriage. METHODS: We utilized data from a population-based cohort study of pregnant women (n = 1061) of which 172 (16\%) women had a miscarriage. Upon study entry, participants were asked about their alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Based on the average number of drinks per week, women were categorized into one of three categories: four or more drinks per week (n = 32, 3\%), less than four drinks per week (n = 403, 38\%), and no alcohol intake (n = 626, 59\%). In addition, women were categorized by the type of alcohol beverage they consumed: beer only (n = 47, 4\%), spirits only (n = 56, 5\%), wine only (n = 160, 15\%), or a combination of two or more types of alcohol (n = 172, 16\%). RESULTS: A significant increased risk of miscarriage (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR): 2.65; 95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.38, 5.10) was found for women who drank four or more drinks a week. Our findings also suggest the relationship between alcohol intake during pregnancy and miscarriage is strongest for miscarriage occurring prior to 10 weeks of gestation. In addition, women who drank only spirits had more than a two-fold increased risk of miscarriage compared to women who abstained (aHR: 2.24; 95\% CI: 1.32, 3.81). Conclusions/Importance: Future research assessing the factors that may contribute to an increased risk of miscarriage should consider the type of alcohol consumed.},

  abstract = {The increasing prevalence of obesity during pregnancy raises concerns over the intergenerational transmission of obesity and its potential to exacerbate the current obesity epidemic. The fetal origins hypothesis posits that the intrauterine environment might have lasting effects on children's outcomes. A large literature establishes that mother's pre- pregnancy obesity is correlated with obesity in her children. However, previous research is largely based on comparing individuals across families and hence cannot control for unobservable factors associated with both maternal and child obesity. We use both within- family comparisons and an instrumental variable approach on a sample of 4435 children to identify the effect of maternal pre-pregnancy obesity on obesity in preschool-aged children. Consistent with extant research, OLS models that rely on across-family comparisons indicate a significant correlation between maternal pre-pregnancy obesity and preschool obesity. However, maternal fixed effects render those associations insignificant. Instrumenting for mother's BMI with her sisters' BMI values confirms the null result indicating that the in utero transmission of obesity is likely not driving the increase in childhood obesity.},

Problems found in these studies were grouped into three categories: subject and methods issues, environmental factors, and outcome measurement. The combined average intelligence quotient/developmental quotient (IQ/DQ) of all low birth weight groups was 97.77 (SD 6.19); for control subjects the mean IQ/DQ was 103.78 (SD 8.16). This difference was statistically significant but perhaps not clinically significant. No differences in mean IQ/DQ scores were found among the low birth weight, very low birth weight, and extremely low birth weight subgroups. Statistically significant differences among all groups and control subjects were found when categoric data were analyzed, as were differences among the three subgroups; however, the variety of outcome criteria makes interpretation of the categoric analyses difficult.},

Maternal characteristics and prenatal factors were compared for 1,279 live born infants with gastroschisis and 3,069,678 without. Data were obtained using the California database containing linked hospital discharge, birth certificate and death records from 1 year prior to the birth to 1 year after the birth. Backwards-stepwise logistic regression models were used with maternal factors where initial inclusion was determined by a threshold of p {$<$} 0.10 on initial crude analyses. Due to the strong association of gastroschisis with young maternal age, models were stratified by age groups and odds ratios were calculated. These final models identified maternal infection as the only risk factor common to all age groups and a protective effect of obesity and gestational hypertension. In addition, age specific risk factors were identified. Although gestation at the time of infection was not available, a sexually transmitted disease complicating pregnancy was associated with increased risk in the less than 20 years of age grouping whereas viral infection was associated with increased risk only in the 20\textendash 24 and more than 24 years of age groupings. Urinary tract infection remained in the final logistic model for women less than 20 years. Short interpregnancy interval was not found to be a risk factor for any age group. Our findings support the need to explore maternal infection by type and gestational timing. \textcopyright{} 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract = {The Lese are subsistence farmers living in the Ituri Forest of north-east Za\"ire. They exhibit significant birth seasonality, with lowest frequencies of conception when food production is least, nutritional status is low and ovarian function, as measured by salivary steroid hormone levels, is reduced. Efe pygmy foragers, who live in the same geographical area but are less dependent on cultivated foods and have a more flexible life style, do not exhibit frequent fluctuations in nutritional status nor significant birth seasonality. These findings support a model of birth seasonality relating climatic variables to variation in fertility through a causal chain linking rainfall to food production to energy balance to ovarian function to fertility. The model, which emphasises an ecological approach to the study of human reproduction, should have broad applicability since seasonality of food production and energy balance is widespread geographically and across a wide variety of economies and cultures. Researchers compared 1980-87 data on rainfall, garden size, nutritional status, ovarian function, and births among the Lese subsistence farmers and the nomadic Efe pygmies who lived in the Ituri Forest in northeast Zaire to analyze the ecology of human birth seasonality. Natural fertility for the Lese was 2.35 and 2.56 for the Efe. Rainfall patterns determined the size of Lese gardens (p.05) which in turn determined nutritional status for both the Lese and the Efe (p.01), but particularly the Lese. Negative changes in female nutritional status diminished ovarian function. Specifically, women with lower indices of weight for height and who had lost 2 kg during the study had lower peak progesterone levels and ovulatory frequency than women who lost =or 2 kg. Menstrual cycles lengthened and duration of menstrual flow decreased with a decline in nutritional status. Conceptions were significantly reduced in May-July for the Lese (p=.012). For both Efe and Lese women, conceptions were lowest in May and highest in September. Lese women experienced considerably fewer conceptions during the periods with poor food availability than during other months (p=.002). The corresponding p value was almost significant for Efe women (.55). Thus Efe women experience less fluctuations in nutritional status than did Lese women, but variability in the seasonal pattern of rainfall did determine variation in fertility. The causal chain was rainfall - determined food production which determined energy balance which determined ovarian function which determined fertility. This model can be applied to any population in any geographic region. It integrates knowledge of behavior and cultural practices with the biology of human reproduction.},

METHODS: The 3D-Study (2010-2012) is a prospective cohort study, which sought to improve the understanding among perinatal events, obstetric outcomes, and child development. A total of 2,366 pregnant women were recruited, of whom 278 conceived with ART: ovarian stimulation, intrauterine sperm insemination, in vitro fertilization, intracytoplasmic sperm injection, or in vitro maturation. Natural conception was defined as the unassisted establishment of pregnancy. Cognitive, motor, and language neuro developmental outcomes were compared between ART and natural conception groups at 24 months using the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, 3rd edition, and the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventories. Adjusted linear regression models evaluated the effect of ART on neurodevelopmental outcomes using natural conception as a reference. RESULTS: A total of 175 children in the ART group (62.9\%) and 1,345 children in the natural conception group (64.4\%) underwent neurodevelopmental assessment at 24 months postpartum. After adjusting for relevant confounders, children born after ART showed no difference in Bayley scales' cognitive scores (B1 [standard error]=-1.60 [0.9], 95\% confidence interval [CI] -3.36 to 0.16), composite motor scores (B1 [standard error]=-1.33 [1.0], 95\% CI -3.29 to 0.63), or MacArthur-Bates language scores (B1 [standard error]=-0.28 [2.1], 95\% CI -4.39 to 3.83). No difference was observed when independent ART techniques were compared nor when comparing in vivo (ovarian stimulation or intrauterine insemination) or in vitro (in vitro fertilization, intracytoplasmic sperm injection, or in vitro maturation) techniques (P{$>$}.05). CONCLUSION: Children born after ART had similar cognitive, motor, and language development as children born after natural conception at 2 years of age. These findings may be useful in the clinical counseling of patients undergoing ART.},

Intervention(s): Semistructured interviews. Main Outcome Measure(s): Women's reported experiences of being diagnosed with endometriosis. Result(s): Delays in the diagnosis of endometriosis occur at an individual patient level and a medical level, as both women and family doctors normalize symptoms, symptoms are suppressed through hormones, and nondiscriminatory investigations are relied upon. Women benefited from a diagnosis, because it provided a language in which to discuss their condition, offered possible management strategies to control symptoms, and provided reassurance that symptoms were not due to cancer. Diagnosis also sanctioned women's access to social support and legitimized absences from social and work obligations. Conclusion(s): Although recent guidelines for the management of chronic pelvic pain suggest that diagnostic laparoscopy may be considered a secondary investigation after the failure of therapeutic interventions, the present study highlights the importance of an early diagnosis for women who suffer at physical, emotional, and social levels when they remain undiagnosed. ?? 2006 American Society for Reproductive Medicine.},

  abstract = {Background: In cardiovascular research, pre-hospital mortality represents an important potential source of selection bias. Inverse probability of censoring weights are a method to account for this source of bias. The objective of this article is to examine and correct for the influence of selection bias due to pre-hospital mortality on the relationship between cardiovascular risk factors and all-cause mortality after an acute cardiac event. Methods: The relationship between the number of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors (0-5; smoking status, diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and obesity) and all-cause mortality was examined using data from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study. To illustrate the magnitude of selection bias, estimates from an unweighted generalized linear model with a log link and binomial distribution were compared with estimates from an inverse probability of censoring weighted model. Results: In unweighted multivariable analyses the estimated risk ratio for mortality ranged from 1.09 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.98-1.21) for 1 CVD risk factor to 1.95 (95\% CI, 1.41-2.68) for 5 CVD risk factors. In the inverse probability of censoring weights weighted analyses, the risk ratios ranged from 1.14 (95\% CI, 0.94-1.39) to 4.23 (95\% CI, 2.69-6.66). Conclusion: Estimates from the inverse probability of censoring weighted model were substantially greater than unweighted, adjusted estimates across all risk factor categories. This shows the magnitude of selection bias due to pre-hospital mortality and effect on estimates of the effect of CVD risk factors on mortality. Moreover, the results highlight the utility of using this method to address a common form of bias in cardiovascular research.},

However, too often, studies fail to acknowledge the importance of measurement bias in causal inference. In the presence of measurement bias, the aforementioned identifiability conditions are not sufficient to estimate a causal effect. The most fundamental requirement for estimating a causal effect is knowing who is truly exposed and unexposed. In this issue of the Journal, Caniglia et al. (Am J Epidemiol. 2019;000(00):000-000) present a thorough discussion of methodological challenges when estimating causal effects in the context of research on distance to obstetrical care. Their article highlights empirical strategies for examining nonexchangeability due to unmeasured confounding and selection bias and potential violations of the consistency assumption. In addition to the important considerations outlined by Caniglia et al., authors interested in estimating causal effects from observational data should also consider implementing quantitative strategies to examine the impact of misclassification. The objective of this commentary is to emphasize that you can't drive a car with only three wheels, and you also cannot estimate a causal effect in the presence of exposure misclassification bias.},

We discuss two common forms of selection bias in aging research: (1) survivor bias and (2) bias due to loss to follow-up. Our objective was to review these two forms of selection bias in geriatrics research. In clinical aging research, selection bias is a particular concern because all participants must have survived to old age, and be healthy enough, to take part in a research study in geriatrics. DESIGN: We demonstrate the key issues related to selection bias using three case studies focused on obesity, a common clinical risk factor in older adults. We also created a Selection Bias Toolkit that includes strategies to prevent selection bias when designing a research study in older adults and analytic techniques that can be used to examine, and correct for, the influence of selection bias in geriatrics research. RESULTS: Survivor bias and bias due to loss to follow-up can distort study results in geriatric populations. Key steps to avoid selection bias at the study design stage include creating causal diagrams, minimizing barriers to participation, and measuring variables that predict loss to follow-up. The Selection Bias Toolkit details several analytic strategies available to geriatrics researchers to examine and correct for selection bias (eg, regression modeling and sensitivity analysis). CONCLUSION: The toolkit is designed to provide a broad overview of methods available to examine and correct for selection bias. It is specifically intended for use in the context of aging research.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Covariate selection to reduce bias in observational data analysis has primarily relied upon statistical criteria to guide researchers. This approach may lead researchers to condition on variables that ultimately increase bias in the effect estimates. The use of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) aids researchers in constructing thoughtful models based on hypothesised biologic mechanisms to produce the least biased effect estimates possible. METHODS After providing an overview of different relations in DAGs and the prevailing mechanisms by which conditioning on variables increases or reduces bias in a model, we illustrate examples of DAGs for maternal antidepressants in pregnancy and four separate perinatal outcomes. RESULTS By comparing and contrasting the diagrams for maternal antidepressant use in pregnancy and spontaneous abortion, major malformations, preterm birth, and postnatal growth, we illustrate the different conditioning sets required for each model. Moreover, we illustrate why it is not appropriate to condition on the same set of covariates for the same exposure and different perinatal outcomes. We further discuss potential selection biases, overadjustment of mediators on the causal path, and sufficient sets of conditioning variables. CONCLUSION In our efforts to construct parsimonious models that minimise confounding and selection biases, we must rely upon our scientific knowledge of the causal mechanism. By structuring data collection and analysis around hypothesised DAGs, we ultimately aim to validly estimate the causal effect of interest.},

While mean birthweight is lower in high rainfall areas, both magnitude and predictability of seasonal birthweight variations are greater in low rainfall areas. Such differences are attributed to different combinations of infection rates, dietary intake and reliability of food supply. Seasonal variations in birthrate were found to occur independently from those of birthweight. Birth seasonality was found to be prominent only in areas with holoendemic malaria and is attributed to a seasonal depression of fecundity mainly due to malaria infection.},

This pattern does not correspond with the usual explanations of birth seasonality. Conceptions are most frequent at the period of highest temperature, which is contrary to the theory that predicts them to be more frequent during the dry season. The drop of the conception rate during the wet agricultural season suggests that stress on women may be the main cause of birth seasonality in Tanzania. Due to wet conditions and frequent staying on in the rice fields, exposure to malaria increases during the rainy season's latter part. The negative association of the number of births with rainfall in the months preceding conception indicates that almost half of the variation in the number of births may be due to the effects of malaria and physical exhaustion on fecundity. The remainder may be    attributable to seasonal variations in pregnancy loss and sexual behavior. The absence of strong birth seasonality in nonholoendemic areas of Tanzania and the low birth rate in holoendemic areas provide further support for a critical role for malaria infection. The fact that the magnitude of seasonal variation in births increases with high parity and has decreased over the past decade results from recent changes in Tanzania's rural economy. Young people in Tanzania are progressively withdrawing from agriculture, especially when they have no children yet.},

We show that recoverability is feasible if and only if our condition holds.

This article treats a particular problem of generalizability, called "transportability", defined as a license to transfer information learned in experimental studies to a different population, on which only observational studies can be conducted. Given a set of assumptions concerning commonalities and differences between the two populations, Pearl and Bareinboim (2011) derived sufficient conditions that permit such transfer to take place. This article summarizes their findings and supplements them with an effective procedure for deciding when and how transportability is feasible. It establishes a necessary and sufficient condition for deciding when causal effects in the target population are estimable from both the statistical information available and the causal information transferred from the experiments. The article further provides a complete algorithm for computing the transport formula, that is, a way of combining observational and experimental information to synthesize bias-free estimate of the desired causal relation. Finally, the article examines the differences between transportability and other variants of generalizability.},

The availability of multiple heterogeneous datasets presents new opportunities to big data analysts, because the knowledge that can be acquired from combined data would not be possible from any individual source alone. However, the biases that emerge in heterogeneous environments require new analytical tools. Some of these biases, including confounding, sampling selection, and cross-population biases, have been addressed in isolation, largely in restricted parametric models. We here present a general, nonparametric framework for handling these biases and, ultimately, a theoretical solution to the problem of data fusion in causal inference tasks.},

Some authors have suggested that it may contribute to more family stress than IVF. Methods: ICSI conceived children were compared with IVF conceived children and naturally conceived (NC) controls. They were selected in five European countries: Belgium, Denmark, Greece, Sweden and the UK, and seen for psychological testing and a paediatric examination when they were 5 years old. In all countries, except Greece, mothers and fathers were asked to complete questionnaires about parental well-being, family relationships, parenting and child behaviour. Results: Very few differences were found between the ICSI and NC group or the ICSI and IVF group. The only significant differences were that mothers in the ICSI conceived group reported fewer hostile or aggressive feelings towards the child and higher levels of commitment to parenting than the mothers of NC children. Conclusions: The study confirms the results of previous work with IVF families. This should be encouraging for families using these techniques in the future. \textcopyright{} European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology 2004; all rights reserved.},

Study Design and Setting A short historical narrative, with concrete examples, and arguments based on an understanding of the practice of health research and evidence synthesis. Results Health research has played a key role in developing today's gold standard for causal inference\textemdash the randomized controlled multiply blinded trial. Historically, allocation approaches developed from convenience and purposive allocation to alternate and, finally, to random allocation. This development was motivated both by concerns for manipulation in allocation as well as statistical and theoretical developments demonstrating the power of randomization in creating counterfactuals for causal inference. In contrast to the sequential development of experiments, quasi-experiments originated at very different points in time, from very different scientific perspectives, and with frequent and long interruptions in their methodological development. Health researchers have only recently started to recognize the value of quasi-experiments for generating novel insights on causal relationships. Conclusion While quasi-experiments are unlikely to replace experiments in generating the efficacy and safety evidence required for clinical guidelines and regulatory approval of medical technologies, quasi-experiments can play an important role in establishing the effectiveness of health care practice, programs, and policies. The papers in this series describe and discuss a range of important issues in utilizing quasi-experimental designs for primary research and quasi-experimental results for evidence synthesis.},

  abstract = {Missing data are a commonly occurring threat to the validity and efficiency of epidemiologic studies. Perhaps the most common approach to handling missing data is to simply drop those records with 1 or more missing values, in socalled "complete records" or "complete case" analysis. In this paper,we bring together earlier-derived yet perhaps now somewhat neglected results which show that a logistic regression complete records analysis can provide asymptotically unbiased estimates of the association of an exposure of interest with an outcome, adjusted for a number of confounders, under a surprisingly wide range of missing-data assumptions. We give detailed guidance describing how the observed data can be used to judge the plausibility of these assumptions. The results mean that in large epidemiologic studies which are affected by missing data and analyzed by logistic regression, exposure associations may be estimated without bias in a number of settings where researchers might otherwise assume that bias would occur.},

Propensity score based methods were used to control for potential confounders, including maternal demographic characteristics, obstetric and medical conditions, and use of other drugs.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nRESULTS: 1152 (0.13\%) women used a statin during the first trimester. In unadjusted analyses, the prevalence of malformations in the offspring of these women was 6.34\% compared with 3.55\% in those of women who did not use a statin in the first trimester (relative risk 1.79, 95\% confidence interval 1.43 to 2.23). Controlling for confounders, particularly pre-existing diabetes, accounted for this increase in risk (1.07, 0.85 to 1.37). There were also no statistically significant increases in any of the organ specific malformations assessed after accounting for confounders. Results were similar across a range of sensitivity analyses.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSIONS: Our analysis did not find a significant teratogenic effect from maternal use of statins in the first trimester. However, these findings need to be replicated in other large studies, and the long term effects of in utero exposure to statins needs to be assessed, before use of statins in pregnancy can be considered safe.},

Design Prospective cohort study alongside individual participant meta-analysis of other cohort studies. Setting United Kingdom. Participants Analytical sample of 499 701 people (response rate 5.5\%) in analyses in UK Biobank; pooled data from the Health Surveys for England (HSE) and the Scottish Health Surveys (SHS), including 18 studies and 89 895 people (mean response rate 68\%). Both study populations were linked to the same nationwide mortality registries, and the baseline age range was aligned at 40-69 years. Main outcome measure Death from cardiovascular disease, selected malignancies, and suicide. To quantify the difference between hazard ratios in the two studies, a ratio of the hazard ratios was used with HSE-SHS as the referent. Results Risk factor levels and mortality rates were typically more favourable in UK Biobank participants relative to the HSE-SHS consortium. For the associations between risk factors and mortality endpoints, however, close agreement was seen between studies. Based on 14 288 deaths during an average of 7.0 years of follow-up in UK Biobank and 7861 deaths over 10 years of mortality surveillance in HSE-SHS, for cardiovascular disease mortality, for instance, the age and sex adjusted hazard ratio for ever having smoked cigarettes (versus never) was 2.04 (95\% confidence interval 1.87 to 2.24) in UK Biobank and 1.99 (1.78 to 2.23) in HSE-SHS, yielding a ratio of hazard ratios close to unity (1.02, 0.88 to 1.19). The overall pattern of agreement between studies was essentially unchanged when results were compared separately by sex and when baseline years and censoring dates were aligned. Conclusion Despite a very low response rate, risk factor associations in the UK Biobank seem to be generalisable.},

  abstract = {Background: Physical inactivity is an established risk factor for several cancers of the digestive system and female reproductive organs, but the evidence for liver cancers is less conclusive. Methods: The aim of this study was to synthesize prospective observational studies on the association of physical activity and liver cancer risk by means of a systematic review and meta-analysis. We searched Medline, Embase, and Scopus from inception to January 2019 for prospective studies investigating the association of physical activity and liver cancer risk. We calculated mean hazard ratios (HRs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) using a random-effects model. We quantified the extent to which an unmeasured confounder or an unaccounted selection variable could shift the mean hazard ratio to the null. Results: Fourteen prospective studies, including 6,440 liver cancers, were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis. The mean hazard ratio for high compared with low physical activity was 0.75 (95\% CI = 0.63 to 0.89; 95\% prediction interval = 0.52 to 1.07; I = 64.2\%). We estimated that 67.6\% (95\% CI = 56.6\% to 78.5\%) of all true effect estimates would have a hazard ratio less than 0.8. Bias analysis suggested than an unobserved confounder would have to be associated with a 1.99-fold increase in the risk of physical activity or liver cancer to explain away the observed mean hazard ratio. An unaccounted for selection variable would have to be related to exposure and endpoint with a relative risk of 1.58 to explain away the mean hazard ratio. Conclusions: Physical activity is inversely related to the risk of liver cancer. Further studies with objectively measured physical activity and quasi-experimental designs addressing confounding are needed.},

For children in middle childhood, development seems comparable in children born after assisted reproduction and controls, although fewer studies have been conducted with follow-up to this age. Very few studies have assessed neurodevelopmental outcomes among teens, and the results are inconclusive.

  abstract = {The National Heart Lung Blood Institute Nutrition Data System was examined with regard to sources of variance. A Graeco-Latin square design involving 30 male and 30 female subjects, each interviewed six times, three trained interviewers and three interview days was used. Through factorial analysis of variance it was demonstrated that there was no difference between interviewers and no training effect associated with the sequence of interviews. Conversely, there was a strong sex difference in absolute nutrient intake, and in females, but not males, a strong day of the week effect. Both of these disappeared when nutrient concentrations (in proportion to energy) were examined. In a direct comparison of centrally computed and hand calculated nutrient vectors from 60 recalls, it was found that data handling contributed a small component of variance for most nutrients studied. This variance was larger in the case of the polyunsaturated fatty acids and the P:S ratio. When the ratio of interindividual (true between subject variation in "usual" intake) coefficient of variation over intraindividual (day by day variation in intake, day of the week variation in females, any methodological errors) coefficient of variation was calculated, it was found to be between I and 1.2 for absolute intakes of energy, protein, total carbohydrate, total fat, and monounsaturated fatty acids, and to rise to 1.7 to 2.1 for polyunsaturated fatty acids and cholesterol. When the nutrients were expressed in proportion to energy, total variance tended to fall, interindividual variance fell and intraindividual variance was affected to a much lesser degree. The ratio rose sharply. The presence of intraindividual variation will bias estimates of correlation coefficients and of regression slopes toward 0 and will result in missclassification of subjects into ranges of usual dietary intakes. Erroneous interpretations may be placed on negative findings in epidemiological studies. This problem is not eliminated by increasing group size. Knowledge of the partitioning of variance may be of considerable benefit in examining relationships between variables as in diet-lipid-heart disease studies and in the design of future studies.},

The design and conduct of QEs, effect sizes from QEs, and moderator variables for the analysis of those effect sizes were discussed. Results Biases, confounding, design complexities, and comparisons across designs offer serious challenges to syntheses of QEs. Key components of meta-analyses of QEs were identified, including the aspects of QE study design to be coded and analyzed. Of utmost importance are the design and statistical controls implemented in the QEs. Such controls and any potential sources of bias and confounding must be modeled in analyses, along with aspects of the interventions and populations studied. Because of such controls, effect sizes from QEs are more complex than those from randomized experiments. A statistical meta-regression model that incorporates important features of the QEs under review was presented. Conclusion Meta-analyses of QEs provide particular challenges, but thorough coding of intervention characteristics and study methods, along with careful analysis, should allow for sound inferences.},

Humans and animals are daily exposed to chemical pollutants that could adversely influence physiological processes and potentially cause diseases, including endometriosis. In this review, the authors aimed at settling the influence of environmental and dietary factors on endometriosis pathogenesis. The mechanism by which dioxin and its similes (TCDD/PCBs) act changing the endometrial physiology  remains uncertain and is speculative due to the difficulty in assessing the exposure over intrauterine life, childhood and adulthood and its actual consequences, in addition to the limitations to its in vitro reproducibility. We  need to better understand the mechanism of action of these environmental pollutants, not only on reproductive health, but also on overall health of individuals and so prevention strategies, including not only population education, but setting exposure limits, less polluting techniques and a better use of our natural resources, could be promoted.},

  abstract = {Metabolic stressful challenges during susceptible time windows, such as fetal life, can have important implications for health throughout life. Deletion of the p66(Shc) gene in mice leads to reduced oxidative stress (OS), resulting in a healthy and lean phenotype characterized by increased metabolic rate, resistance to high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity and reduced emotionality at adulthood. Here we hypothesize that p66(Shc-/-) (KO) adult offspring might be protected from the detrimental effects induced by maternal HFD administered before and during pregnancy. To test such hypothesis, we fed p66(Shc+/+) (WT) and KO females with HFD for 13 weeks starting on 5 weeks of age until delivery and tested adult male and female offspring for their metabolic, neuroendocrine, and emotional profile. Prenatal diet affected stress responses and metabolic features in a gender-dependent fashion. In particular, prenatal HFD increased plasma leptin levels and decreased anxiety-like behavior in females, while increasing body weight, particularly in KO subjects. KO mice were overall characterized by metabolic resiliency, showing a blunted change in glycemia levels in response to glucose or insulin challenges. However, in p66(Shc-/-) mice, prenatal HFD affected glucose tolerance response in an opposite manner in the two genders, overriding the resilience in males and exacerbating it in females. Finally, KO females were protected from the disrupting effect of prenatal HFD on neuroendocrine response. These findings indicate that prenatal HFD alters the emotional profile and metabolic functionality of the adult individual in a gender-dependent fashion and suggest that exposure to high-caloric food during fetal life is a stressful condition interfering with the developmental programming of the adult phenotype. Deletion of the p66(Shc) gene attenuates such effects, acting as a protective factor.},

  abstract = {STUDY QUESTION What is the semen quality of young adult men who were conceived 18-22 years ago by ICSI for male infertility? SUMMARY ANSWER In this cohort of 54 young adult ICSI men, median sperm concentration, total sperm count and total motile sperm count were significantly lower than in spontaneously conceived peers. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY The oldest ICSI offspring cohort worldwide has recently reached adulthood. Hence, their reproductive health can now be investigated. Since these children were conceived by ICSI because of severe male-factor infertility, there is reasonable concern that male offspring have inherited the deficient spermatogenesis from their fathers. Previously normal pubertal development and adequate Sertoli and Leydig cell function have been described in pubertal ICSI boys; however, no information on their sperm quality is currently available. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION This study was conducted at UZ Brussel between March 2013 and April 2016 and is part of a large follow-up project focussing on reproductive and metabolic health of young adults, between 18 and 22 years and conceived after ICSI with ejaculated sperm. Results of both a physical examination and semen analysis were compared between young ICSI men being part of a longitudinally followed cohort and spontaneously conceived controls who were recruited cross-sectionally. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHOD Results of a single semen sample in 54 young adult ICSI men and 57 spontaneously conceived men are reported. All young adults were individually assessed, and the results of their physical examination were completed by questionnaires. Data were analysed by multiple linear and logistic regression, adjusted for covariates. In addition, semen parameters of the ICSI fathers dating back from their ICSI treatment application were analysed for correlations. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE Young ICSI adults had a lower median sperm concentration (17.7 million/ml), lower median total sperm count (31.9 million) and lower median total motile sperm count (12.7 million) in comparison to spontaneously conceived peers (37.0 million/ml; 86.8 million; 38.6 million, respectively). The median percentage progressive and total motility, median percentage normal morphology and median semen volume were not significantly different between these groups. After adjustment for confounders (age, BMI, genital malformations, time from ejaculation to analysis, abstinence period), the statistically significant differences between ICSI men and spontaneously conceived peers remained: an almost doubled sperm concentration in spontaneously conceived peers in comparison to ICSI men (ratio 1.9, 95\% CI 1.1-3.2) and a two-fold lower total sperm count (ratio 2.3, 95\% CI 1.3-4.1) and total motile count (ratio 2.1, 95\% CI 1.2-3.6) in ICSI men compared to controls were found. Furthermore, compared to men born after spontaneous conception, ICSI men were nearly three times more likely to have sperm concentrations below the WHO reference value of 15 million/ml (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 2.7; 95\% CI 1.1-6.7) and four times more likely to have total sperm counts below 39 million (AOR 4.3; 95\% CI 1.7-11.3). In this small group of 54 father-son pairs, a weak negative correlation between total sperm count in fathers and their sons was found. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION The main limitation is the small study population. Also, the results of this study where ICSI was performed with ejaculated sperm and for male-factor infertility cannot be generalized to all ICSI offspring because the indications for ICSI have nowadays been extended and ICSI is also being performed with non-ejaculated sperm and reported differences may thus either decrease or increase. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS These first results in a small group of ICSI men indicate a lower semen quantity and quality in young adults born after ICSI for male infertility in their fathers.

A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses-the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

METHODS: We investigated recency and duration of OC use in relation to molecular subtypes of breast cancer in a pooled analysis of data from the African American Breast Cancer Epidemiology and Risk Consortium. The study included 1,848 women with estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer, 1,043 with ER-negative (ER-) breast cancer (including 494 triple negative (TN) tumors, which do not have receptors for estrogen, progesterone, and human epidermal growth factor 2), and 10,044 controls. Multivariable polytomous logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) for exposure categories relative to never use, controlling for potential confounding variables. RESULTS: OC use within the previous 5 years was associated with increased risk of ER+ (OR 1.46, 95\% CI 1.18 to 1.81), ER- (OR 1.57, 95\% CI 1.22 to 1.43), and TN (OR 1.78, 95\% CI 1.25 to 2.53) breast cancer. The risk declined after cessation of use but was apparent for ER+ cancer for 15 to 19 years after cessation and for ER- breast cancer for an even longer interval after cessation. Long duration of use was also associated with increased risk of each subtype, particularly ER-. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that OC use, particularly recent use of long duration, is associated with an increased risk of ER+, ER-, and TN breast cancer in African American women. Research into mechanisms that explain these findings, especially the association with ER- breast cancer, is needed.},

However,web surveys are not without methodological problems. Specific groups in the populations are under-represented because they have less access to Internet. Furthermore, recruitment of respondents is often based on self-selection. Both under-coverage and self-selection may lead to biased estimates. This paper describes these methodological problems. It also explores the effect of various correction techniques (adjustment weighting and use of reference surveys). This all leads to the question whether properly design web surveys can be used for data collection. The paper attempts to answer this question. It concludes that under-coverage problems may solve itself in the future, but that self-selection leads to unreliable survey outcomes. \textcopyright{} 2010 The Author.

We investigated whether higher surrounding greenness in early life was associated with subsequent reduced risk of depressive symptoms and whether this association was modified by age, sex, or population density. Methods: Participants from the Growing Up Today Study were included if they reported on depressive symptoms between 1999 and 2013. Greenness exposure was characterized as the cumulative average normalized difference vegetation index value (1000 m resolution) from 1989 until 2 years before outcome assessment or age 18 based on geocoded addresses. We defined high depressive symptoms as the top 10\% of scores on the McKnight Risk Factor Survey or the Center for Epidemiologic Studies of Depression scale, depending on the questionnaire. Data were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards model adjusted for socioeconomic status and other confounders. Results: There was a 6\% lower incidence of high depressive symptoms associated with an interquartile range increase in greenness (95\% confidence interval, 11\%\textendash 0\%). This relationship was stronger in higher population density areas ({$>$}1000 people/mi2, 8\% lower incidence, 95\% confidence interval 15\%\textendash 1\%).

Among 2,955 individuals, we compared 108 genotypes, 8 haplotypes, and 9 to 15 short tandem repeats by respondent type.

  abstract = {Obesity is well characterized as a systemic inflammatory condition, and is also associated with cognitive disruption, suggesting a link between the two. We assessed whether peripheral inflammation in maternal obesity may be transferred to the offspring brain, in particular, the hippocampus, and thereby result in cognitive dysfunction. Rat dams were fed a high-saturated-fat diet (SFD), a high-trans-fat diet (TFD), or a low-fat diet (LFD) for 4 wk prior to mating, and remained on the diet throughout pregnancy and lactation. SFD/TFD exposure significantly increased body weight in both dams and pups compared to controls. Microglial activation markers were increased in the hippocampus of SFD/TFD pups at birth. At weaning and in adulthood, proinflammatory cytokine expression was strikingly increased in the periphery and hippocampus following a bacterial challenge [lipopolysaccharide (LPS)] in the SFD/TFD groups compared to controls. Microglial activation within the hippocampus was also increased basally in SFD rats, suggesting a chronic priming of the cells. Finally, there were marked changes in anxiety and spatial learning in SFD/TFD groups. These effects were all observed in adulthood, even after the pups were placed on standard chow at weaning, suggesting these outcomes were programmed early in life.},

All three groups were similar for socioeconomic status, cigarette smoking, and ethnicity. Maternal age of group 1 was similar to that of group 3, but group 2 mothers were significantly older. Gravidity was significantly higher in groups 1 and 2 compared with group 3. No statistical difference was found in spontaneous abortion rate among the three groups, but the stillbirth rate was significantly higher in group 1 ({$\xi$}2=6.89, P{$\leq$}0.01). All stillbirths were related to abruptio placentae. Birth weight, length, and head circumference were significantly decreased in infants in groups 1 and 2 compared with group 3 (P{$\leq$}0.0001), but no statistical difference was found between groups 1 and 2. The congenital malformation rate was significantly higher in group 1 compared with group 3 ({$\xi$}2=7.07, P{$\leq$}0.01). We conclude that cocaine abuse in humans significantly reduces weight of the fetus, increases the stillbirth rate related to abruptio placentae, and is associated with a higher malformation rate.},

However, recent studies have indicated that dioxin also induces functional developmental defects, many of which are delayed. Subtle structural deficits, not detectable at birth, have also been described in multiple species and in both sexes. Certain defects have been reported not only in animals but also in children prenatally exposed to complex mixtures containing dioxinlike compounds. None of the effects can be attributed to modulation of any one endocrine system. For example, dioxin does not bind to the estrogen receptor, but it can cause effects that are both estrogenic and antiestrogenic. However, viewing dioxin and related compounds as endocrine disruptors that may alter multiple pathways sheds some light on the complexities of this potent class of growth dysregulators.},

Evidence shows that dioxin (2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin) can increase the incidence and severity of the disease in monkeys and can promote the growth or survival of endometrial tissue implanted into rodents in a surgically induced model of endometriosis. The mechanism of the connection between organochlorine chemicals and endometriosis is not clear. Effects on growth factors, cytokines, and hormones (components of the immune and endocrine systems) are potential means of mediating the possible promotion of endometriosis by dioxins. Studies on epidemiology and on structure-activity relationships of organochlorine chemicals and endometriosis have been additional approaches to this problem. In this regard, toxic equivalence (TEQ) appears to be an important determinant of the effects of organochlorine chemicals on endometriosis. In this article, we review the literature related to endometriosis and dioxins and attempt to integrate the various sources of information that bolster the hypothesis connecting dioxins and endometriosis.},

However, no study has examined whether emerging adults who currently witness interparental violence are more likely to exhibit violence in their own intimate relationships. Data were analyzed from undergraduate students (N = 223) attending an ethnically diverse Southern California university. Multivariate linear regression analyses were used to examine the impact of witnessing interparental violence on the physical and psychological IPV experienced in emerging adult relationships. The joint effects of witnessing both forms of interparental violence were also tested. Support for the intergenerational transmission of violence was identified for specific types of violence. Future directions of study and implications for prevention and treatment are offered. \textcopyright{} The Author(s) 2010.},

  abstract = {This second paper in the Born Too Soon supplement presents a review of the epidemiology of preterm birth, and its burden globally, including priorities for action to improve the data. Worldwide an estimated 11.1\% of all livebirths in 2010 were born preterm (14.9 million babies born before 37 weeks of gestation), with preterm birth rates increasing in most countries with reliable trend data. Direct complications of preterm birth account for one million deaths each year, and preterm birth is a risk factor in over 50\% of all neonatal deaths. In addition, preterm birth can result in a range of long-term complications in survivors, with the frequency and severity of adverse outcomes rising with decreasing gestational age and decreasing quality of care. The economic costs of preterm birth are large in terms of immediate neonatal intensive care, ongoing long-term complex health needs, as well as lost economic productivity. Preterm birth is a syndrome with a variety of causes and underlying factors usually divided into spontaneous and provider-initiated preterm births. Consistent recording of all pregnancy outcomes, including stillbirths, and standard application of preterm definitions is important in all settings to advance both the understanding and the monitoring of trends. Context specific innovative solutions to prevent preterm birth and hence reduce preterm birth rates all around the world are urgently needed. Strengthened data systems are required to adequately track trends in preterm birth rates and program effectiveness. These efforts must be coupled with action now to implement improved antenatal, obstetric and newborn care to increase survival and reduce disability amongst those born too soon. Declaration.

The children participated between 2003 and 2008 in a neuropsychological assessment of cognitive ability including IQ tests taken by both the mother and the child. Linear regression analyses were used to estimate the associations between parental BMI and child IQ adjusted for a comprehensive set of potential confounders. Child IQ was assessed with the Wechsler Primary and Preschool Scales of Intelligence - Revised (WPPSI-R).\textbackslash n\textbackslash nRESULTS: The crude association between maternal BMI and child IQ showed that BMI was adversely associated with child IQ with a reduction in IQ of -0.40 point for each one unit increase in BMI. This association was attenuated after adjustment for social factors and maternal IQ to a value of -0.27 (-0.50 to -0.03). After mutual adjustment for the father's BMI and all other factors except maternal IQ, the association between paternal BMI and child IQ yielded a regression coefficient of -0.26 (-0.59 to 0.07), which was comparable to that seen for maternal BMI (-0.20 (-0.44 to 0.04)).\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSION: Although maternal pre-pregnancy BMI was inversely associated with the IQ of her child, the similar association with paternal BMI suggests that it is not a specific pregnancy related adiposity effect.},

Obesity was classified as obese I (30.0-34.9), obese II (35.0-39.9), and obese III ({$\geq$}40.0). Logistic regression was used to calculate the adjusted odds ratios and 95\% confidence interval, representing the association between pre-pregnancy BMI and each of the 26 specific birth defects (and an 'any birth defect' composite). Models were adjusted for maternal age, race/ethnicity, education, smoking, marital status, and nativity.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nRESULTS: The livebirth prevalence of any birth defect increased with increasing BMI, from 3.9\% among underweight women to 5.3\% among obese III women (P {$<$} 0.001). Results show a direct dose-response relationship between maternal pre-pregnancy BMI and 10 defects under study (cleft palate without cleft lip, diaphragmatic hernia, hydrocephalus without spina bifida, hypoplastic left heart syndrome, pulmonary valve atresia and stenosis, pyloric stenosis, rectal and large intestinal atresia/stenosis, transposition of great arteries, tetralogy of Fallot, and ventricular septal defects) and the 'any birth defect' category. Conversely, gastroschisis exhibited a statistically significant inverse relationship with pre-pregnancy BMI.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence of the increasing risk of birth defect-affected pregnancy with increasing pre-pregnancy obesity. Reducing pre-pregnancy obesity, even among obese women, may reduce the occurrence of birth defects.},

  abstract = {The number of births varies markedly by season, but the causes of this variation are not well understood. The proposed explanations include temperature or photoperiod (affecting hormonal concentrations, sperm quality or sexual activity), seasonal variation in pregnancy loss, or cultural factors. In this paper we examined whether birth seasonality is influenced by socio-demographic factors. We used data on all live births registered in the Czech Republic in 1989-1991 (n = 387 496). Differences in the degree of seasonality between socio-demographic groups (defined by maternal age, marital status, education and birth order) were examined by inspection of curves, by comparing coefficients of variations of monthly numbers of births, and by calculating the ratios of the number of births in the 3 peak months (March to May) to the number of births in the 3 lowest months (October to December). We found large differences in the size of the seasonal variation in births by socio-demographic factors. The seasonal variation was highly pronounced in mothers who were 25-34 years old, had higher education, were married, and were pregnant with their second or third child. By contrast, birth seasonality was weak in mothers who were {$<$} or =19 years or {$>$} or =35 years old, unmarried, had low education, and expected their first or fourth or higher order birth. In a multivariate model, all four socio-demographic variables contributed significantly to seasonal variation. These results suggest that the seasonality of births is, at least in this population, strongly influenced by socio-demographic factors.},

  abstract = {There is a consensus that malaria is a growing problem in African highlands. This is surprising because many parts of the highlands were considered too cold to support transmission. In this report, we examined how transmission of Plasmodium falciparum in six villages changed along an altitude transect in the Usambara Mountains, Tanzania, from 300 m to 1700 m. Routine entomological collections were made using spray catches and light traps for 15 mo. Direct estimates of entomological inoculation rates and indirect estimates of vectorial capacity suggested a {$>$}1000-fold reduction in transmission intensity between the holoendemic lowland and the hypoendemic highland plateau. Lowland transmission was perennial with a significant peak in the cool season after the long rains in May, when vectors densities were high. In the highlands, low temperatures prevented parasite development in mosquitoes during the cool season rains, and highland transmission was therefore limited to the warm dry season when vector densities were low. The primary effect of increasing altitude was a log-linear reduction in vector abundance and, to a lesser extent, a reduction in the proportion of infective mosquitoes. Highland malaria transmission was maintained at extraordinarily low vector densities. We discuss herein the implications of these findings for modeling malaria and suggest that process-based models of malaria transmission risk should be improved by considering the direct effect of temperature on vector densities. Our findings suggest that variation in the short rains in November and changes in agricultural practices are likely to be important generators of epidemics in the Usambaras.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Conventional measures of gestational weight gain (GWG) are correlated with pregnancy duration, and may induce bias to studies of GWG and perinatal outcomes. A maternal weight-gain-for-gestational-age z-score chart is a new tool that allows total GWG to be classified as a standardised z-score that is independent of gestational duration. Our objective was to compare associations with perinatal outcomes when GWG was assessed using gestational age-standardised z-scores and conventional GWG measures. METHODS: We studied normal-weight (n = 522 120) and overweight (n = 237 923) women who delivered liveborn, singleton infants in Pennsylvania, 2003-11. GWG was expressed using gestational age-standardised z-scores and three traditional measures: total GWG (kg), rate of GWG (kg per week of gestation), and the GWG adequacy ratio (observed GWG/GWG recommended by the Institute of Medicine). Log-binomial regression models were used to assess associations between GWG and preterm birth, and small- and large-for-gestational-age births, while adjusting for race/ethnicity, education, smoking, and other confounders. RESULTS: The association between GWG z-score and preterm birth was approximately U-shaped. The risk of preterm birth associated with weight gain {$<$}10th percentile of each measure was substantially overestimated when GWG was classified using total kilogram and was moderately overestimated using rate of GWG or GWG adequacy ratio. All GWG measures had similar associations with small- or large-for-gestational-age birth. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that studies of gestational age-dependent outcomes misspecify associations if total GWG, rate of GWG, or GWG adequacy ratio are used. The potential for gestational age-related bias can be eliminated by using z-score charts to classify total GWG.},

We selected a sample of residents of Seveso, Italy, who were acutely exposed to high levels of dioxin following an accident in 1976. We conducted a toxicokinetic analysis which takes into account species and exposure differences in dose and timing between humans and monkeys. The area under the time-concentration curve for dioxin in fat, which corresponds to cumulative exposure over time, ranges for some of the most heavily exposed Seveso residents from approximately 1.7 x 106 ppt-days to 1.1 x 108 ppt-days. These values exceed in all cases the values for the monkeys exposed to 25 ppt or 5 ppt. Given their exposure, the Seveso population should be an ideal epidemiologic cohort to rule out or confirm whether exposure to dioxin leads to an increased risk of endometriosis in humans},

Study Design and Setting: We used OVID Medline and the online archives of the Journal of the American Medical Association to search for cluster randomized trials published between January 2015 and June 2017 from four high-impact journals and compared them to a matched sample of individually randomized trials. Results: We identified 23 cluster trials: 57\% (n = 13) described a robust allocation method and 17\% (n = 4) recruited all participants before randomization. Four (17\%), eight (35\%), and 11 (48\%) were classified as at low, medium, and high bias risk, respectively. Meta-analysis showed significant age imbalance (-0.05, 95\% CI = -0.057 to -0.043, I2 = 93.2\%) in cluster trials, while the matched individually randomized trials showed no imbalance (0.005, 95\% CI = -0.026 to 0.035, I2 = 0\%). Cluster trials finding a statistically significant outcome in their primary measure showed a larger age imbalance (0.082, 95\% CI = -0.091 to -0.073, I2 = 87\%) than trials finding a nonstatistically significant outcome (0.022, 95\% CI = 0.008 to 0.035, I2 = 83\%). Conclusions: There is strong evidence in this sample of an effect of selection bias seen in an imbalance in baseline participant age, something not seen in a comparable sample of individually randomized trials.},

  abstract = {Background: We consider whether widowhood increases mortality risk. Although commonly observed, this "widowhood effect" could be due to selection effects, as married couples share various characteristics related to the risk of death. We therefore consider the widowhood effect by various causes of spousal death; some causes of death are correlated with shared characteristics in couples, while others are not. Methods: Using data from the Scottish Longitudinal Study, we compare outcomes for men and women by the causes of death of their spouse, controlling for a range of individual- and household-level characteristics. Results: The widowhood effect in these data is greater than has been found in other recent studies, with adjusted hazard ratios of 1.40 (95\% confidence interval = 1.33-1.47) for men and 1.36 (1.30-1.44) for women. The risk is highest shortly after widowhood, but remains raised for at least 10 years. There was little evidence that these hazard ratios differed by any classification of the cause of death of the spouse, but interactions were found for those with pre-existing illness or other risk factors. The hazard ratios for widowhood were lower for persons with preexisting risks. Conclusions: Our analysis of the widowhood effect uses 3 methods of classifying the causes of spousal death in an attempt to control for potential selection effects. Our results are highly consistent and suggest that this is a causal effect, rather than a result of selection. \textcopyright{} 2010 by Lippincott Williams \& Wilkins.},

  abstract = {Although measures of the home environment have gained wide acceptance in the child development literature, what constitutes the "average" or 'typical" home environment in the United States, and how this differs across ethnic groups and poverty status is not known. Item-level data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth on four age-related versions of the Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment-Short Form (HOME-SF) from five biennial assessments (1986-1994) were analyzed for the total sample and for four major ethnic groups: European Americans, Asian Americans, African Americans, and Hispanic Americans. The percentages of homes receiving credit on each item of all four versions of the HOME-SF are described. For the majority of items at all four age levels differences between poor and nonpoor families were noted. Differences were also obtained among African American, European American, and Hispanic American families, but the magnitude of the effect for poverty status was greater than for ethnicity, and usually absorbed most of the ethnic group effects on HOME-SF items. For every item at every age, the effects of poverty were proportional across European American, African American, and Hispanic American groups.},

In this brief report, we aim to explore three subtleties of marginal structural models. First, we distinguish marginal structural models from the inverse probability weighting estimator, and we emphasize that marginal structural models are not only for longitudinal exposures. Second, we explore the meaning of the word "marginal" in "marginal structural model." Finally, we show that the specification of a marginal structural model can have important implications for the interpretation of its parameters. Each of these concepts have important implications for the use and understanding of marginal structural models, and thus providing detailed explanations of them may lead to better practices for the field of epidemiology.},

Here we describe bounds for the risk difference for an effect of a binary exposure on a binary outcome in 4 common study settings: observational studies and randomized studies, each with and without simple random selection from the target population. Through these scenarios, we introduce randomizations for selection and treatment, and the widths of the bounds are narrowed from 2 (the width of the range of the risk difference) to 0 (point identification). We then assess the strength of the assumptions of exchangeability for internal and external validity by comparing their contributions to the widths of the bounds in the setting of an observational study without random selection from the target population. We find that when less than two-thirds of the target population is selected into the study, the assumption of exchangeability for external validity of the risk difference is stronger than that for internal validity. The relative strength of these assumptions should be considered when designing, analyzing, and interpreting observational studies and will aid in determining the best methods for estimating the causal effects of interest.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To test for a suspected adverse effect of low birth weight ({$<$} or = 2500 g) on IQ at age 6 years in two socioeconomically disparate populations. DESIGN: Nonconcurrent prospective study. SETTING: An urban, predominantly disadvantaged population and a suburban middle-class population in southeastern Michigan. PARTICIPANTS: Low-birth-weight (N = 473) and normal-birth-weight (N = 350) subjects, randomly selected from the 1983 through the 1985 newborn lists of two major hospitals, one serving an urban and the other a suburban population. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised to measure IQ. RESULTS: The mean full-scale IQ of low-birth-weight children was 4.9 points lower than that of normal-birth-weight children, controlling for population site, maternal IQ, maternal education, and race (95\% confidence interval [CI], 3.0 to 6.8). There was no evidence of low-birth-weight interaction with population site, and the same IQ difference was detected in both populations. In the urban population, low birth weight was associated with an increased risk for IQ below 85 (odds ratio, 2.2; 95\% CI, 1.3 to 3.7). In the suburban population, low birth weight was associated with an increased risk for IQ below 100 (odds ratio, 2.0; 95\% CI, 1.2 to 3.4). A gradient relationship with full-scale IQ was observed, with the largest deficit in those born weighing 1500 g or less, an intermediate deficit in those born weighing 1501 through 2000 g, and the least pronounced deficit in those born weighing 2001 through 2500 g. CONCLUSIONS: The overall effect of low birth weight represents an increase of approximately 10\% of low-birth-weight children with an IQ of more than 1 SD below the population's mean. Children born weighing 2000 g or less bore the major burden of the IQ deficits},

We conducted a prospective study of a general population sample of those born in Dunedin, New Zealand, between April 1, 1972, and March 30, 1973 (95.4\% retention of cohort after 38 years of prospective follow-up). Residence in a CWF area, use of fluoride dentifrice and intake of 0.5-milligram fluoride tablets were assessed in early life (prior to age 5 years); we assessed IQ repeatedly between ages 7 to 13 years and at age 38 years. Results. No significant differences in IQ because of fluoride exposure were noted. These findings held after adjusting for potential confounding variables, including sex, socioeconomic status, breastfeeding, and birth weight (as well as educational attainment for adult IQ outcomes). Conclusions. These findings do not support the assertion that fluoride in the context of CWF programs is neurotoxic. Associations between very high fluoride exposure and low IQ reported in previous studies may have been affected by confounding, particularly by urban or rural status. (Am J Public Health.

In Greenlandic men, AHR variants significantly modified the association between serum levels of both p,p'-DDE and CB-153 and inhibin B levels, sperm chromatin integrity, and seminal zinc levels. In the total cohort, interactions between AHRR variants and serum levels of CB-153 were associated with sperm chromatin integrity and the expression of the pro-apoptotic marker protein Fas. The data indicate that susceptibility to adverse effects of POP exposure on male reproductive function is dependent on polymorphisms in genes involved in AHR signalling.},

The objective of this paper is to consider various analytic approaches for odds ratio estimation in this situation. One approach is to perform the usual matched-pairs analysis; the alternative is to combine pairs into strata and compute the conditional maximum likelihood or Mantel-Haenszel estimate. Matched-pairs analysis based on theoretic and simulation results may give misleading inferences, although on average it performs nearly as well as the stratified analysis. The occasional poor performance of the matched-pairs analysis results from the possibility of obtaining an extreme number of discordant pairs due to the random pairing within a stratum. It is concluded that the prudent policy is to perform a stratified rather than a paired analysis, even at the expense of additional computation.},

  abstract = {Copyright \textcopyright{} 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved. Background: The literature theorizes, but does not test, that variation over time in selective loss in utero affects the observed count of live-born birth defects cases. We test the hypothesis that the risk of birth defects among live-born males varies inversely with the strength of selection against males in utero. Methods: We identified a subset of six birth defect phenotypes among males from the California Birth Defects Monitoring Program, an active surveillance system for over 490,000 male singletons born in eight California counties from 1986 to 2004. We assigned each birth defect case infant to a monthly conception cohort at risk of selection in utero. We used the monthly sex ratio at birth (M:F), derived from each conception cohort, as the indicator of selection against males. We analyzed the odds ratio of birth defects with both individual-level logistic regression and aggregate time-series methods. Results: Consistent with selection in utero, male infants from conception cohorts with low outlying sex ratios (i.e., stronger selectivity) exhibit fewer than expected birth defects (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 0.86; 95\% confidence interval [CI]  = 0.76, 0.98). Aggregate time-series tests also yield similar findings (OR = 0.81; 95\% CI = 0.71, 0.90). Conclusions: Our findings among males indicate that variation in the strength of selectivity in utero accounts for a portion of observed cohort differences in morbidity due to birth defects. These findings suggest that "revealed prevalence" of morbidity across birth cohorts varies, at least in part, from selective loss in utero. See video abstract at, http://links.lww.com/EDE/B209.},

The study population comprised 979,444 live births to upstate New York (exclusive of New York City) resident mothers between 1980 and 1986. Data were abstracted from vital records (birth certificates) and analyzed using a variety of descriptive statistics. Mothers of Native American and black infants had similar antenatal profiles (that is, younger, higher parity, lower educational attainment, and delayed initiation of prenatal care), which differed from mothers of white or other race infants. Despite having at-risk mothers, Native American infants were similar to white and other race infants with respect to the percentage of births that were considered low birth weight or premature. Black infants were twice as likely as the other three groups of infants to be low birth weight or premature. These findings suggest that other factors appear to be important in determining neonatal outcome and that typical at-risk antenatal profile of mothers may not be consistent across all racial groups.},

Parent and adolescent dyads self-reported on their emotion regulation difficulties and adolescents reported on their perceptions of parent invalidation (i.e., punishment and neglect) of emotions and their own internalizing and externalizing behaviors. Results showed that parents who reported higher levels of emotion dysregulation tended to invalidate their adolescent's emotional expressions more often, which in turn related to higher levels of adolescent emotion dysregulation.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Previous research found that prenatal cocaine exposure (PCE) may increase children's vulnerability to behavior and cognition problems. Maturational changes in brain and social development make adolescence an ideal time to reexamine associations. The objective was to conduct a systematic review of published studies examining associations between PCE and adolescent development (behavior, cognition/school outcomes, physiologic responses, and brain morphology/functioning).\textbackslash n\textbackslash nMETHODS: Articles were obtained from PubMed, PsycInfo, Web of Science, and CINAHL databases through July 2012 with search terms: prenatal drug, substance, or cocaine exposure; adolescence/adolescent; and in utero substance/drug exposure. Criteria for inclusion were nonexposed comparison group, human adolescents aged 11 to 19, peer-reviewed, English-language, and adolescent outcomes.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nRESULTS: Twenty-seven studies representing 9 cohorts met the criteria. Four outcome categories were identified: behavior, cognition/school performance, brain structure/function, and physiologic responses. Eleven examined behavior; 7 found small but significant differences favoring nonexposed adolescents, with small effect sizes. Eight examined cognition/school performance; 6 reported significantly lower scores on language and memory tasks among adolescents with PCE, with varying effect sizes varied. Eight examined brain structure/function and reported morphologic differences with few functional differences. Three examined physiologic responses with discordant findings. Most studies controlled for other prenatal exposures, caregiving environment, and violence exposure; few examined mechanisms.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSIONS: Consistent with findings among younger children, PCE increases the risk for small but significantly less favorable adolescent functioning. Although the clinical importance of differences is often unknown, the caregiving environment and violence exposure pose additional threats. Future research should investigate mechanisms linking PCE with adolescent functioning.},

If occupational data are not analyzed using appropriate methods, this bias can result in attenuation or even reversal of the estimated effects of exposures on health outcomes. Recent advances in computing power, coupled with state-of-the-art statistical methods, have greatly increased the ability of analysts to control healthy worker survivor bias. However, these methods have not been widely adopted by occupational epidemiologists. We update the seminal review by Arrighi and Hertz-Picciotto (Epidemiology.1994; 5: 186-196) of the sources and methods to control healthy worker survivor bias. In our update, we discuss methodologic advances since the publication of that review, notably with a consideration of how directed acyclic graphs can inform the choice of appropriate analytic methods. We summarize and discuss methods for addressing this bias, including recent work applying g-methods to account for employment status as a time-varying covariate affected by prior exposure. In the presence of healthy worker survivor bias, g-methods have advantages for estimating less biased parameters that have direct policy implications and are clearly communicated to decision-makers.},

  abstract = {STUDY QUESTION: Is female infertility predictive of a woman's future risk of early cardiovascular disease (CVD)? SUMMARY ANSWER: Female infertility does not seem to be predictive of early CVD during a mean follow-up of 9 years. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Associations between infertility and comorbidity have been found in several studies, but data on the association between female infertility and risk of CVD are scarce and inconclusive. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: In this nationwide cohort study, we included 87 221 women registered in the Danish National IVF register, undergoing medically assisted reproduction (MAR) between 1st of January 1994 and 31st of December 2015. The cohort was followed for incident hospitalization due to CVD in the Danish National Patient Register from enrollment to 31 December 2015. Women with a history of CVD prior to enrollment were excluded. Cox proportional hazard models with age as the underlying time scale were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) with 95\% CI of CVD among women with an infertility diagnosis, compared to women without an infertility diagnosis. All analyses were adjusted for educational attainment. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Female infertility and the reason for infertility was diagnosed and registered in the IVF register by specialists in Danish public and private fertility clinics since 1st of January 1994. In our cohort, 53 806 women (61.7\%) were diagnosed with female factor infertility, while 33 415 (38.3\%) did not have a female factor infertility diagnosis and made up the reference group. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: A total of 686 (1.3\%) infertile women were hospitalized for CVD compared to 250 (0.7\%) among women without an infertility diagnosis during a mean follow-up time of 9 years. We found no increased risk of early CVD in our analyses (adjusted HR 0.98, 95\% CI: 0.85;1.14). Likewise, analyses stratified by specific infertility diagnosis, showed no risk difference. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: We were unable to adjust for confounding parameters such as body mass index, cigarette smoking or alcohol consumption. These results may not be generalizable to infertile women who do not seek out fertility treatment, or infertile women with other lifestyle characteristics than Danish women. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Diagnosing female infertility or the time of MAR does not seem to be a window of opportunity where early screening for cardiovascular disease risk factors can have a prophylactic potential.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Increasing evidence suggests exposure to adverse conditions in intrauterine life may increase the risk of developing attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in childhood. High maternal pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) has been shown to predict child ADHD symptoms, however the neurocognitive processes underlying this relationship are not known. The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that this association is mediated by alterations in child executive function.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nMETHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A population-based cohort of 174 children (mean age = 7.3 {$\pm$} 0.9 (SD) yrs, 55\% girls) was evaluated for ADHD symptoms using the Child Behavior Checklist, and for neurocognitive function using the Go/No-go task. This cohort had been followed prospectively from early gestation and birth through infancy and childhood with serial measures of maternal and child prenatal and postnatal factors. Maternal pre-pregnancy BMI was a significant predictor of child ADHD symptoms (F((1,158)) = 4.80, p = 0.03) and of child performance on the Go/No-go task (F((1,157)) = 8.37, p = 0.004) after controlling for key potential confounding variables. A test of the mediation model revealed that the association between higher maternal pre-pregnancy BMI and child ADHD symptoms was mediated by impaired executive function (inefficient/less attentive processing; Sobel Test: t = 2.39 ({$\pm$} 0.002, SEM), p = 0.02).\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: To the best of our knowledge this is the first study to report that maternal pre-pregnancy BMI-related alterations in child neurocognitive function may mediate its effects on ADHD risk. The finding is clinically significant and may extrapolate to an approximately 2.8-fold increase in the prevalence of ADHD among children of obese compared to those of non-obese mothers. These results add further evidence to the growing awareness that neurodevelopmental disorders such as ADHD may have their foundations very early in life.},

Parental responses to the Behavior Problem Index (BPI) were used for construction of an overall BPI score, as well as subscale scores. Crosstabulation and linear and logistic regression were used to determine the relation of the different condition categories to emotional and/or behavioral problems expressed by relative values of the BPI.Results:\textbackslash nChildren with asthma and comorbid conditions had a mean BPI score of 7.3, compared with 5.4 for children without chronic conditions, and all subscale scores, except those for antisocial antisocial conduct and immature behavior, were significantly elevated. Using logistic regression to control for confounding variables, children with severe asthma alone had nearly three times the odds (odds ratio, 2.96; 95\% confidence interval, 1.22 to 7.17) and children with asthma plus comorbid conditions nearly twice the odds (odds ratio, 1.86; 95\% confidence interval, 1.20 to 2.90) of children without chronic conditions to have severe behavior problems.Conclusions:\textbackslash nSevere asthma and asthma with medical comorbidity represent significant risk factors for emotional and/or behavioral problems. Clinicians caring for children with asthma and their families should be aware of the relationship between asthma and emotional and/or behavioral problems and anticipate that a substantial number of their patients may have mental health services needs.(Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med. 1995;149:565-572)},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Breastfeeding has been shown to enhance global measures of intelligence in children. However, few studies have examined associations between breastfeeding and specific cognitive task performance in the first 2 y of life, particularly in an Asian population. OBJECTIVE: We assessed associations between early infant feeding and detailed measures of cognitive development in the first 2 y of life in healthy Asian children born at term. DESIGN: In a prospective cohort study, neurocognitive testing was performed in 408 healthy children (aged 6, 18, and 24 mo) from uncomplicated pregnancies (i.e., birth weight {$>$}2500 and {$<$}4000 g, gestational age {$\geq$}37 wk, and 5-min Apgar score {$\geq$}9). Tests included memory (deferred imitation, relational binding, habituation) and attention tasks (visual expectation, auditory oddball) as well as the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Third Edition (BSID-III). Children were stratified into 3 groups (low, intermediate, and high) on the basis of breastfeeding duration and exclusivity. RESULTS: After potential confounding variables were controlled for, significant associations and dose-response relations were observed for 4 of the 15 tests. Higher breastfeeding exposure was associated with better memory at 6 mo, demonstrated by greater preferential looking toward correctly matched items during early portions of a relational memory task (i.e., relational binding task: P-trend = 0.015 and 0.050 for the first two 1000-ms time bins, respectively). No effects of breastfeeding were observed at 18 mo. At 24 mo, breastfed children were more likely to display sequential memory during a deferred imitation memory task (P-trend = 0.048), and toddlers with more exposure to breastfeeding scored higher in receptive language [+0.93 (0.23, 1.63) and +1.08 (0.10, 2.07) for intermediate- and high-breastfeeding groups, respectively, compared with the low-breastfeeding group], as well as expressive language [+0.58 (-0.06, 1.23) and +1.22 (0.32, 2.12) for intermediate- and high-breastfeeding groups, respectively] assessed via the BSID-III. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest small but significant benefits of breastfeeding for some aspects of memory and language development in the first 2 y of life, with significant improvements in only 4 of 15 indicators. Whether the implicated processes confer developmental advantages is unknown and represents an important area for future research. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01174875.},

This paper describes an approach for using observational data to emulate randomized clinical trials that compare dynamic regimes of the form ``initiate treatment within a certain time period of some time-varying covariate first crossing a particular threshold." We applied this method to data from the French Hospital database on HIV (FHDH-ANRS CO4), an observational study of HIV-infected patients, in order to compare dynamic regimes of the form "initiate treatment within m months after the recorded CD4 cell count first drops below x cells/mm3" where x takes values from 200 to 500 in increments of 10 and m takes values 0 or 3. We describe the method in the context of this example and discuss some complications that arise in emulating a randomized experiment using observational data.},

  abstract = {Background: When a clinical treatment fails or shows suboptimal results, the question of when to switch to another treatment arises. Treatment switching strategies are often dynamic because the time of switching depends on the evolution of an individual's time-varying covariates. Dynamic strategies can be directly compared in randomized trials. For example, HIV-infected individuals receiving antiretroviral therapy could be randomized to switching therapy within 90 days of HIV-1 RNA crossing above a threshold of either 400 copies/ml (tight-control strategy) or 1000 copies/ml (loose-control strategy). Methods: We review an approach to emulate a randomized trial of dynamic switching strategies using observational data from the Antiretroviral Therapy Cohort Collaboration, the Centers for AIDS Research Network of Integrated Clinical Systems and the HIV-CAUSAL Collaboration. We estimated the comparative effect of tight-control vs. loose-control strategies on death and AIDS or death via inverse-probability weighting. Results: Of 43 803 individuals who initiated an eligible antiretroviral therapy regimen in 2002 or later, 2001 met the baseline inclusion criteria for the mortality analysis and 1641 for the AIDS or death analysis. There were 21 deaths and 33 AIDS or death events in the tight-control group, and 28 deaths and 41 AIDS or death events in the loose-control group. Compared with tight control, the adjusted hazard ratios (95\% confidence interval) for loose control were 1.10 (0.73, 1.66) for death, and 1.04 (0.86, 1.27) for AIDS or death. Conclusions: Although our effective sample sizes were small and our estimates imprecise, the described methodological approach can serve as an example for future analyses.},

Abstract: Fifty-six mothers and their 24-month-old toddlers were observed on two occasions in a series of laboratory procedures designed to assess relations between emotional functioning (emotional reactivity and emotion regulation) in an individual assessment and social behavior with a same-sex peer. Emotional reactivity was assessed using two frustration tasks designed to elicit distress. Emotional regulation was assessed by examining the child's behaviors (venting, distraction, focal-object focus, self-orientation, and mother-orientation) when confronted by the two distress-eliciting tasks. Peer play behaviors were coded for social participation and peer-directed conflict (aggressive) behavior. The results indicated that both emotional reactivity and emotion regulation were important predictors of at least two types of social behavior: conflict and cooperation. Distress to frustration, when accompanied by high venting or high focal-object focus, was significantly related to conflict with peers but not when accompanied by distraction, mother-orientation or self-focused behaviors. These findings are discussed in terms of the adaptive value of emotion regulation skills in early development, and the importance of identifying the causal relations between child regulation and early social competence.},

They compared the AI health risks and health status with those of other persons (non-AI) living in Umatilla County, and assessed the progress of both AI and non-AI populations toward selected 1990 national health objectives. This AI population is likely to achieve the 1990 national health objective calling for less than 5 percent of births to be low birth weight (LBW); the LBW rate decreased from 5.0 percent in 1977-80 to 4.1 percent in 1984-86. However, the population is not likely to achieve the 1990 objective calling for at least 90 percent of women to begin prenatal care during the first trimester, even though the proportion of AI women who began prenatal care in the first trimester increased from 42.3 percent in 1973-76 to 62.6 percent in 1984-86. The Yellowhawk Indian Health Center began offering clinical services to AI in Umatilla County in 1976. Compared with non-AI women, AI women closed large gaps in key health risk and health status indicators during the period from 1973 to 1986. For example, from 1973 to 1976, 14.6 percent of AI mothers compared with 6.3 percent of non-AI mothers began prenatal care in the last trimester. By 1984 to 1986, only 9.0 percent of AI and 7.9 percent of non-AI mothers began prenatal care in the last trimester. Several other desirable health indicators improved more for AI than for non-AI from 1973 to 1986. These indicators included receiving at least one prenatal care visit during pregnancy, beginning prenatal care before the last trimester, and a larger proportion of mothers more than 18 years of age.Data from vital records can be used to monitor the health status of minority populations in small areas, such as counties. Clinic personnel serving minority groups can incorporate national and local health objectives into their strategy for improving community health.},

Even when these assumptions are met, biased effect estimates can result if selection bias allows a noncausal path from E to Y. We demonstrate the presence of bias in IV analyses on a sample from a simulated dataset, where selection into the sample was a collider on a noncausal path from E to Y. By applying inverse probability of selection weights, we were able to eliminate the selection bias. IV approaches may protect against unmeasured confounding but are not immune from selection bias. Inverse probability of selection weights used with IV approaches can minimize bias.},

At age 5 1/2 years, children were administered the Working Memory and Planning Battery of the Cambridge Neuropsychological Testing Automated Battery. Measures of sociodemographic characteristics of the family, prenatal and perinatal risk, quality of caregiving and crowding in the home, and maternal and child intelligence were used as covariates to test the hypothesis that children with higher lifetime average blood lead concentrations would perform more poorly on tests of working memory, attentional flexibility, and planning and problem solving. The lifetime average blood lead level in this sample was 7.2 micrograms per deciliter (mug/dL; range: 0-20 mug/dL). Children with greater exposure performed more poorly on tests of executive processes. In both bivariate and multivariate analyses, children with higher lifetime average blood lead concentrations showed impaired performance on the tests of spatial working memory, spatial memory span, intradimensional and extradimensional shifts, and an analog of the Tower of London task. Many of the significant associations remained after controlling for children's intelligence test scores, in addition to the other covariates. These findings indicate that the effects of pediatric lead exposure are not restricted to global indexes of general intellectual functioning, and executive processes may be at particular risk of lead-induced neurotoxicity.},

Design: Prospective studies of HIV-positive individuals in Europe and the USA in the HIV-CAUSAL Collaboration and The Center for AIDS Research Network of Integrated Clinical Systems. Methods: Antiretroviral-naive individuals who initiated ART and became virologically suppressed within 12 months were followed from the date of suppression. We compared 3 CD4 cell count and HIV-RNA monitoring strategies: once every (1) 3 6 1 months, (2) 6 6 1 months, and (3) 9-12 6 1 months. We used inverseprobability weighted models to compare these strategies with respect to clinical, immunologic, and virologic outcomes. Results: In 39,029 eligible individuals, there were 265 deaths and 690 AIDS-defining illnesses or deaths. Compared with the 3-month strategy, the mortality hazard ratios (95\% CIs) were 0.86 (0.42 to 1.78) for the 6 months and 0.82 (0.46 to 1.47) for the 9-12 month strategy. The respective 18-month risk ratios (95\% CIs) of virologic failure (RNA .200) were 0.74 (0.46 to 1.19) and 2.35 (1.56 to 3.54) and 18-month mean CD4 differences (95\% CIs) were 25.3 (218.6 to 7.9) and 231.7 (252.0 to 211.3). The estimates for the 2-year risk of AIDS-defining illness or death were similar across strategies. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that monitoring frequency of virologically suppressed individuals can be decreased from every 3 months to every 6, 9, or 12 months with respect to clinical outcomes. Because effects of different monitoring strategies could take years to materialize, longer follow-up is needed to fully evaluate this question.},

  abstract = {Decisions about when to start or switch a therapy often depend on the frequency with which individuals are monitored or tested. For example, the optimal time to switch antiretroviral therapy depends on the frequency with which HIV-positive individuals have HIV RNA measured. This paper describes an approach to use observational data for the comparison of joint monitoring and treatment strategies and applies the method to a clinically relevant question in HIV research: when can monitoring frequency be decreased and when should individuals switch from a first-line treatment regimen to a new regimen?. We outline the target trial that would compare the dynamic strategies of interest and then describe how to emulate it using data from HIV-positive individuals included in the HIV-CAUSAL Collaboration and the Centers for AIDS Research Network of Integrated Clinical Systems. When, as in our example, few individuals follow the dynamic strategies of interest over long periods of follow-up, we describe how to leverage an additional assumption: no direct effect of monitoring on the outcome of interest. We compare our results with and without the ``no direct effect'' assumption. We found little differences on survival and AIDS-free survival between strategies where monitoring frequency was decreased at a CD4 threshold of 350 cells/{$\mu$}l compared with 500 cells/{$\mu$}l and where treatment was switched at an HIV-RNA threshold of 1000 copies/ml compared with 200 copies/ml. The ``no direct effect'' assumption resulted in efficiency improvements for the risk difference estimates ranging from an 7- to 53-fold increase in the effective sample size.},

  abstract = {Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a leading cause of birth defects and developmental disabilities. The objective of this study was to identify the characteristics and behaviors of mothers of children with FAS in the United States using population-based data from the FAS Surveillance Network (FASSNet). FASSNet used a multiple source methodology that identified FAS cases through passive reporting and active review of records from hospitals, specialty clinics, private physicians, early intervention programs, Medicaid, birth certificates and other vital records, birth defects surveillance programs, and hospital discharge data. The surveillance included children born during January 1, 1995-December 31, 1997. In the four states included in our analysis - Arizona, New York, Alaska, and Colorado - there were 257 confirmed cases and 96 probable cases for a total of 353 FAS cases. Compared to all mothers in the states where surveillance occurred, mothers of children with FAS were significantly more likely to be older, American Indians/Alaska Natives, Black, not Hispanic, unmarried, unemployed, and without prenatal care, to smoke during pregnancy, to have a lower educational level, and to have more live born children. A significant proportion of mothers (9-29\%) had another child with suspected alcohol effects. Compared to all US mothers, they were also significantly more likely to be on public assistance, to be on Medicaid at their child's birth, to have received treatment for alcohol abuse, to have confirmed alcoholism, to have used marijuana or cocaine during pregnancy, to have their baby screen positive for alcohol or drugs at birth, to have had an induced abortion, to have had a history of mental illness, to have been involved in binge drinking during pregnancy, and to have drunk heavily (7 days/week) during pregnancy. These findings suggest that it is possible to identify women who are at high risk of having a child with FAS and target these women for interventions.},

  abstract = {We consider nonparametric identification and estimation in a nonseparable model where a continuous regressor of interest is a known, deterministic, but kinked function of an observed assignment variable. This design arises in many institutional settings where a policy variable (such as weekly unemployment benefits) is determined by an observed but potentially endogenous assignment variable (like previous earnings). We provide new results on identification and estimation for these settings, and apply our results to obtain estimates of the elasticity of joblessness with respect to UI benefit rates. We characterize a broad class of models in which a sharp ``Regression Kink Design'' (RKD, or RK Design) identifies a readily interpretable treatment-on-the-treated parameter (Florens et al. (2008)). We also introduce a ``fuzzy regression kink design'' generalization that allows for omitted variables in the assignment rule, noncompliance, and certain types of measurement errors in the observed values of the assignment variable and the policy variable. Our identifying assumptions give rise to testable restrictions on the distributions of the assignment variable and predetermined covariates around the kink point, similar to the restrictions delivered by Lee (2008) for the regression discontinuity design. We then use a fuzzy RKD approach to study the effect of unemployment insurance benefits on the duration of joblessness in Austria, where the benefit schedule has kinks at the minimum and maximum benefit level. Our preferred estimates suggest that changes in UI benefit generosity exert a relatively large effect on the duration of joblessness of both low-wage and high-wage UI recipients in Austria.},

A stressful life events index equalled the sum of 'yes' responses to the seven questions. Social support questions were also summed to form an index. Data were analyzed using logistic regression to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95\% confidence intervals (CI), adjusted for maternal race-ethnicity, age, education, body mass index, smoking, drinking, and intake of vitamin supplements.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nRESULTS: Associations with the stress index tended to be higher with higher scores, but few 95\% CIs excluded one. A four-point increase in the index was moderately associated with NTDs (OR 1.5, [95\% CI 1.1, 2.0]) and CLP (OR 1.3, [95\% CI 1.0, 1.7]). The social support index tended to be associated with reduced risk but most 95\% CIs included one, with the exception of dTGA (OR for a score of 3 vs 0 was 0.5 [95\% CI 0.3, 0.8]).\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSIONS: Maternal periconceptional stressful life events, social support, and the two factors in combination were at most modestly, if at all, associated with risks of the studied birth defects.},

After reviewing previous evidence, we present a conceptual framework that highlights data limitations and methodological problems that complicate the study of this topic. We then present estimates of the associations between height and a range of outcomes--including schooling, employment, earnings, health, and cognitive ability--measured in five data sets from early to late adulthood. These results indicate that, on average, taller individuals attain higher levels of education. Height is also positively associated with better economic, health, and cognitive outcomes. These associations are only partially explained by the higher average educational attainment of taller individuals. We then use data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 Children and Young Adults survey to document the associations between health, cognitive development, and growth in childhood. Even among children with the same mother, taller siblings score better on cognitive tests and progress through school more quickly. Part of the differences found between siblings arises from differences in their birth weights and lengths attributable to mother's behaviors while pregnant. Taken together, these results support the hypothesis that childhood health influences health and economic status throughout adulthood.},

Design and Participants: We analyzed interview responses from 954 adolescent control group participants from the National Birth Defects Prevention Study who delivered live infants during 1997-2007. Main Outcome Measures: Adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for factors of interest by age categories (13-15, 16-17, and 18 years, relative to 19 years). To construct a composite periconceptional behavior index, we summed the following healthy behaviors: nonsmoker, nondrinker, folic acid supplementation, and eating 5 or more servings of fruits and vegetables per day. Results: Analyses indicated that women in the youngest group (13-15 years of age) were more likely to be Hispanic (aOR 2.83, 95\% CI 1.40-5.70) and less likely to engage in some unhealthy pregnancy-related behaviors compared with 19-year-olds, such as smoking (aOR 0.45, 95\% CI 0.20-0.99) and being overweight or obese (aOR 0.32, 95\% CI 0.16-0.61). However, they were also less likely to have taken periconceptional folic acid (aOR 0.44, 95\% CI 0.21-0.90). About one-third of teen mothers indicated that their pregnancies had been intended. Among 18- and 19-year-olds, this predicted a higher mean value for the composite periconceptional behavior index (2.30 versus 1.94, P {$\leq$} .01). Conclusions: Teen mothers are not a homogeneous group. Each age subgroup presents varied demographic and behavioral factors that put them at varying levels of risk for birth defects. Furthermore, caregivers should not assume that teens do not plan pregnancies or that they need not be informed of the importance of periconceptional health.},

  abstract = {Gastroschisis offers the intriguing epidemiological situation of a pandemic, strongly associated with very low maternal age. Identifying gastroschisis, and distinguishing it from the other abdominal wall defects, is theoretically easy but difficult in practice. The baseline birth prevalence of gastroschisis before the pandemic was approximately 1 in 50,000 births and has increased since between 10- and 20-fold. In many populations worldwide, it is still increasing. Such increasing prevalence and the association with very low maternal age are well proven, but the interaction between these two findings remains unknown. Geographic gradients (decreasing prevalence from North to South) are clear in Continental Europe and suggestive in Britain and Ireland. Gastroschisis seems more frequent in Caucasians compared to African Blacks and Orientals, and in Northern compared to Southern Europeans. These observations indicate the need for investigating gene\textendash environment interactions. Since the global human situation is marked by inequalities among as well as within countries, the medical care and public health impact of gastroschisis varies widely among regions and social strata. The postnatal benefits of prenatal diagnosis of gastroschisis include family awareness; adequate planning of delivery with alerted obstetrical, pediatric, and surgical staff; optimal risk categorization, and personalized protocol for action. The increasing prevalence of gastroschisis combined with improved medical techniques to reduce morbidity and mortality are also increasing the burden and costs of this anomaly on health systems. \textcopyright{} 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the longitudinal changes in energy expenditure and body composition in relationship to alterations in carbohydrate metabolism in women with normal and abnormal glucose metabolism. We hypothesized that women with decreased insulin sensitivity before conception would have less fat accretion and smaller increases in energy expenditure. STUDY DESIGN: Six women with normal glucose tolerance and 10 women with abnormal glucose tolerance were evaluated before conception, and in early (12 to 14 weeks) and late (34 to 36 weeks) gestation. Body composition was estimated by hydrodensitometry, resting energy expenditure, and glucose and fat metabolism by indirect calorimetry, endogenous glucose production by infusion of [6-6 2H2] glucose, and insulin sensitivity using a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp (40 mU/m2/min). RESULTS: There was a smaller increase in fat mass (1.3 kg [P = .04]) in early pregnancy in women with abnormal glucose tolerance before pregnancy. Indirect calorimetry measured gestational age-related increases in basal oxygen utilization, with or without correction for fat-free mass (VO2, P = .002), resting energy expenditure (expressed in kilocalories, P = .0001), and carbohydrate oxidation (P = .0003). The insulin-mediated elevation in VO2 increased in later gestation VO2 (P = .005), as did resting energy expenditure (P = .0001) and fat oxidation (P = 0.0001). However, there was a decrease in respiratory quotient (P = .0001), carbohydrate oxidation (P = .002), and nonoxidative carbohydrate metabolism (P = .0001) with advancing gestation during insulin infusion. In early pregnancy, changes in fat mass correlated inversely with changes in insulin sensitivity (r= -0.52, P = .04) and changes in basal VO2 correlated inversely with decreases in basal endogenous glucose production (r = -0.74, P = .01). CONCLUSION: In early gestation, the changes in maternal fat mass and basal oxygen consumption are inversely related to the changes in insulin sensitivity. This response in lean women with decreased insulin sensitivity before conception may have survival value by providing a larger amount of available substrate to meet fetoplacental needs during gestation.},

  abstract = {Periviable infants (i.e., those born in the 20th through 26th weeks of gestation) suffer much morbidity and approximately half die in the first year of life. Attempts to explain and predict these births disproportionately invoke a "dysregulation" narrative. Research inspired by this narrative has not led to efficacious interventions. The clinical community has, therefore, urged novel approaches to the problem. We aim to provoke debate by offering the theory, inferred from microeconomics, that risk tolerant women carry, without cognitive involvement, high risk fetuses farther into pregnancy than do other women. These extended high-risk pregnancies historically ended in stillbirth but modern obstetric practices now convert a fraction to periviable births. We argue that this theory deserves testing because it suggests inexpensive and noninvasive screening for pregnancies that might benefit from the costly and invasive interventions clinical research will likely devise.},

  abstract = {Background The emergence of Zika virus in the Americas has coincided with increased reports of babies born with microcephaly. On Feb 1, 2016, WHO declared the suspected link between Zika virus and microcephaly to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. This association, however, has not been precisely quantified. Methods We retrospectively analysed data from a Zika virus outbreak in French Polynesia, which was the largest documented outbreak before that in the Americas. We used serological and surveillance data to estimate the probability of infection with Zika virus for each week of the epidemic and searched medical records to identify all cases of microcephaly from September, 2013, to July, 2015. Simple models were used to assess periods of risk in pregnancy when Zika virus might increase the risk of microcephaly and estimate the associated risk. Findings The Zika virus outbreak began in October, 2013, and ended in April, 2014, and 66\% (95\% CI 62-70) of the general population were infected. Of the eight microcephaly cases identified during the 23-month study period, seven (88\%) occurred in the 4-month period March 1 to July 10, 2014. The timing of these cases was best explained by a period of risk in the first trimester of pregnancy. In this model, the baseline prevalence of microcephaly was two cases (95\% CI 0-8) per 10000 neonates, and the risk of microcephaly associated with Zika virus infection was 95 cases (34-191) per 10000 women infected in the first trimester. We could not rule out an increased risk of microcephaly from infection in other trimesters, but models that excluded the first trimester were not supported by the data. Interpretation Our findings provide a quantitative estimate of the risk of microcephaly in fetuses and neonates whose mothers are infected with Zika virus.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To test the efficacy in terms of birth weight and infant survival of a diet supplement programme in pregnant African women through a primary healthcare system. DESIGN: 5 year controlled trial of all pregnant women in 28 villages randomised to daily supplementation with high energy groundnut biscuits (4.3 MJ/day) for about 20 weeks before delivery (intervention) or after delivery (control). SETTING: Rural Gambia. SUBJECTS: Chronically undernourished women (twin bearers excluded), yielding 2047 singleton live births and 35 stillbirths. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Birth weight; prevalence of low birth weight ({$<$} 2500 g); head circumference; birth length; gestational age; prevalence of stillbirths; neonatal and postneonatal mortality. RESULTS: Supplementation increased weight gain in pregnancy and significantly increased birth weight, particularly during the nutritionally debilitating hungry season (June to October). Weight gain increased by 201 g (P {$<$} 0.001) in the hungry season, by 94 g (P {$<$} 0.01) in the harvest season (November to May), and by 136 g (P {$<$} 0.001) over the whole year. The odds ratio for low birthweight babies in supplemented women was 0.61 (95\% confidence interval 0.47 to 0.79, P {$<$} 0.001). Head circumference was significantly increased (P {$<$} 0.01), but by only 3.1 mm. Birth length and duration of gestation were not affected. Supplementation significantly reduced perinatal mortality: the odds ratio was 0.47 (0.23 to 0.99, P {$<$} 0.05) for stillbirths and 0.54 (0.35 to 0.85, P {$<$} 0.01) for all deaths in first week of life. Mortality after 7 days was unaffected. CONCLUSION: Prenatal dietary supplementation reduced retardation in intrauterine growth when effectively targeted at genuinely at-risk mothers. This was associated with a substantial reduction in the prevalence of stillbirths and in early neonatal mortality. The intervention can be successfully delivered through a primary healthcare system.},

Methods: We used data from the RECORD Cohort Study (REsidential Environment and CORonary heart Disease) carried out in the Paris metropolitan area, France (n = 7233). We performed separate and joint modeling of neighborhood determinants of study participation and type-2 diabetes. We sought to identify selective participation related to neighborhood, and account for any biasing effect on the associations with diabetes. Results: After controlling for individual characteristics, study participation was higher for people residing close to the health centers and in neighborhoods with high income, high property values, high proportion of the population looking for work, and low built surface and low building height (contextual effects adjusted for each other). After individual-level adjustment, the prevalence of diabetes was elevated in neighborhoods with the lowest levels of educational attainment (prevalence odds ratio = 1.56 [95\% credible interval = 1.06-2.31]). Neighborhood effects on participation did not bias the association between neighborhood education and diabetes. However, residual geographic variations in participation weakly biased the neighborhood education-diabetes association. Bias correction through the joint modeling of neighborhood determinants of participation and diabetes resulted in an 18\% decrease in the log prevalence odds ratio for low versus high neighborhood education. Conclusions: Researchers should develop a comprehensive, theory-based model of neighborhood determinants of participation in their study, investigate resulting biases for the environment-health associations, and check that unexplained geographic variations in participation do not bias these environment-health relationships. \textcopyright{} 2010 by Lippincott Williams \& Wilkins.},

We used register data from the Uppsala Birth Cohort Multigenerational Study, based on a representative cohort born in Sweden 1915-1929 (G1). Our sample included 5122 women and 11,204 men who were grandchildren of G1 (G3), their parents (G2), and grandparents. G3's overweight/obesity (BMI ???25kg/m2) was based on pre-pregnancy weight/height for women before their first birth (average age=26 years), and measured weight/height at conscription for men (average age=18 years). G1's, G2's, and G3's highest educational attainment was obtained from routine registers and classified as low, intermediate, or high based on respective sample distributions. Parental (G2) educational trajectory was defined as change in education between their own and their highest educated parent (G1), classified into 5 categories: always advantaged (AA), upward trajectory (UT), stable-intermediate (SI), downward trajectory (DT), and always disadvantaged (AD). We used hierarchical gender-stratified logistic regression models adjusted for G3's age, education, year of BMI collection, lineage and G2's year of birth and income. Grandparental and parental education were negatively associated with men's odds of overweight/obesity and parental education affected women's overweight/obesity risk. Furthermore, men and women whose parents belonged to the UT, SI, DT, and AD groups had greater odds of overweight/obesity compared to men and women whose parents belonged to the AA group (adjusted for G3's age, year of BMI collection, lineage, and G2's year of birth). These associations were attenuated when further adjusting for parental income and G3's own education. Socioeconomic inequalities can have long-term consequences and impact the health of future generations. For overweight/obesity in concurrent young cohorts, this inequality is not fully offset by upward educational trajectory in their parent's generation.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Greater epidemiologic understanding of the relationships among fetal-infant mortality and its prognostic factors, including birthweight, could have vast public health implications. A key step toward that understanding is a realistic and tractable framework for analyzing birthweight distributions and fetal-infant mortality. The present paper is the first of a two-part series that introduces such a framework. METHODS: We propose describing a birthweight distribution via a normal mixture model in which the number of components is determined from the data using a model selection criterion rather than fixed a priori. RESULTS: We address a number of methodological issues, including how the number of components selected depends on the sample size, how the choice of model selection criterion influences the results, and how estimates of mixture model parameters based on multiple samples from the same population can be combined to produce confidence intervals. As an illustration, we find that a 4-component normal mixture model reasonably describes the birthweight distribution for a population of white singleton infants born to heavily smoking mothers. We also compare this 4-component normal mixture model to two competitors from the existing literature: a contaminated normal model and a 2-component normal mixture model. In a second illustration, we discover that a 6-component normal mixture model may be more appropriate than a 4-component normal mixture model for a general population of black singletons. CONCLUSIONS: The framework developed in this paper avoids assuming the existence of an interval of birthweights over which there are no compromised pregnancies and does not constrain birthweights within compromised pregnancies to be normally distributed. Thus, the present framework can reveal heterogeneity in birthweight that is undetectable via a contaminated normal model or a 2-component normal mixture model.},

  abstract = {Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth Child Sample (CNLSY79), we sought to elaborate the complex interplay between childhood health and educational development over the early life course. Our approach made use of sibling comparisons to estimate the relationship between birth weight, cognitive development, and timely high school completion in models that spanned childhood, adolescence, and into early adulthood. Our findings indicated that lower birth weight, even after adjusting for fixed-family characteristics and aspects of the home environment that varied between siblings, was associated with decreased cognitive skills at age 5 and marginally significantly slower growth rates into adolescence. In addition, low birth weight increased the risk of not graduating by age 19, although this relationship reflected differences in cognitive development. Additional moderation analyses provided no evidence that birth weight effects are exacerbated by social conditions. Overall, the pattern of findings painted a complex picture of disadvantage, beginning in the womb and presumably via educational attainment, extending over the life course. \textcopyright{} 2010.},

Three logistic regression models were estimated in an initial sample of 121 children with and without ADHD. These models were then tested in a cross-validation sample (N = 122) and among the 111 brothers and 108 sisters of the initial and cross-validation samples. In all four groups, the CBCL Attention Problems scale had the highest discriminating power for ADHD. Adding other scales did not increase the area under the curve of the ROC significantly. These findings suggest that the CBCL Attention Problems scale could serve as a rapid and useful screening instrument not only to help identify cases likely to meet criteria for ADHD in clinical settings but also to identify cases of ADHD among the siblings of children with ADHD.},

Here, the authors determine whether women with endometriosis have altered levels of PEDF in serum. Peripheral blood samples were collected from 71 women with and without endometriosis (n = 43 and 28, respectively) before laparoscopic surgery. Concentrations of serum PEDF were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We detected lower levels of serum PEDF in women with endometriosis (16.3 {$\pm$} 6.6 ng/mL) than in those without endometriosis (24.5 {$\pm$} 7.3 ng/mL; P {$<$} .001). In women with endometriosis, the concentrations of serum PEDF were significantly lower in women with pain (n = 11, 12.6 {$\pm$} 7.1 ng/mL) compared to women without pain (n = 32, 17.5 {$\pm$} 6.0 ng/mL; P {$<$} .05). However, the concentrations of serum PEDF did not correlate with disease stage or site or infertility. In addition, the concentrations of serum PEDF did not show any difference in the phase of the cycle in either group. Our results suggest that reduced levels of serum PEDF in women with endometriosis and disease-related pain may play a role in the pathogenesis of this disease.},

  abstract = {Background Aboriginal populations are at substantially higher risks of adverse birth outcomes, perinatal and infant mortality than their non-Aboriginal counterparts even in developed countries including Australia, U.S. and Canada. There is a lack of data on recent trends in Canada. Methods We conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study (n = 254,410) using the linked vital events registry databases for singleton births in Quebec 1996\textendash 2010. Aboriginal (First Nations, Inuit) births were identified by mother tongue, place of residence and Indian Registration System membership. Outcomes included preterm birth, small-for-gestational-age, large-for-gestational-age, low birth weight, high birth weight, stillbirth, neonatal death, postneonatal death, perinatal death and infant death. Results Perinatal and infant mortality rates were 1.47 and 1.80 times higher in First Nations (10.1 and 7.3 per 1000, respectively), and 2.37 and 4.46 times higher in Inuit (16.3 and 18.1 per 1000, respectively) relative to non-Aboriginal (6.9 and 4.1 per 1000, respectively) births (all p{$<$}0.001). Compared to non-Aboriginal births, preterm birth rates were persistently (1.7\textendash 1.8 times) higher in Inuit, large-for-gestational-age birth rates were persistently (2.7\textendash 3.0 times) higher in First Nations births over the study period. Between 1996\textendash 2000 and 2006\textendash 2010, as compared to non-Aboriginal infants, the relative risk disparities increased for infant mortality (from 4.10 to 5.19 times) in Inuit, and for postneonatal mortality in Inuit (from 6.97 to 12.33 times) or First Nations (from 3.76 to 4.25 times) infants. Adjusting for maternal characteristics (age, marital status, parity, education and rural vs. urban residence) attenuated the risk differences, but significantly elevated risks remained in both Inuit and First Nations births for the risks of perinatal mortality (1.70 and 1.28 times, respectively), infant mortality (3.66 and 1.47 times, respectively) and postneonatal mortality (6.01 and 2.28 times, respectively) in Inuit and First Nations infants (all p{$<$}0.001). Conclusions Aboriginal vs. non-Aboriginal disparities in adverse birth outcomes, perinatal and infant mortality are persistent or worsening over the recent decade in Quebec, strongly suggesting the needs for interventions to improve perinatal and infant health in Aboriginal populations, and for monitoring the trends in other regions in Canada.},

There was weak evidence, of borderline statistical significance, that having been breastfed was associated with a small reduction in the odds ratios for leukaemia (odds ratio = 0.89, 95\% CI 0.80-1.00, P= 0.06), and for all cancers combined (odds ratio = 0.92, 95\% CI 0.84-1.00, P = 0.05).

These studies, however, have not addressed the healthy-worker survivor effect. Most methods proposed to address this bias do not consider that it may be caused by time-varying confounders affected by prior exposure. G-estimation of accelerated failure-time models was developed to handle this issue but has never been applied to account for the healthy-worker survivor effect. Methods: We compare results from Cox models and g-estimation in 38,747 autoworkers exposed to straight metalworking fluids. Exposure was defined based on job records and air samples. We examine relationships between duration of exposure and mortality from all causes, cancers, ischemic heart disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Results: In standard models, hazard ratios were elevated for cancers of the larynx, prostate, and rectum, but below or approximately equal to 1.0 for all other outcomes considered. Adjustment for the healthy-worker survivor effect using time off work, employment status, time since hire, and restriction to inactive workers after 15 years of follow-up did not substantially change the hazard ratios. However, g-estimation yielded higher hazard ratios than standard Cox models for most outcomes. Exposure was related to increased risks of mortality from all causes combined, heart disease, COPD, and all cancers, as well as lung and prostate cancers. Conclusions: G-estimation may provide a better control for the healthy-worker survivor effect than standard methods.},

  abstract = {Background: Early-life factors can be associated with future health outcomes and are often measured by maternal recall. Methods: We used data from the North Carolina Early Pregnancy Study and Follow-up to characterize long-term maternal recall. We used data from the Early Pregnancy Study as the gold standard to evaluate the accuracy of prepregnancy weight, early pregnancy behaviors, symptoms and duration of pregnancy, and child's birthweight reported at follow-up, for 109 women whose study pregnancies had resulted in a live birth. Results: Most (81\%) participants reported a prepregnancy weight at follow-up that correctly classified them by BMI category. Women reported experiencing pregnancy symptoms later at follow-up than what they reported in the Early Pregnancy Study. Accuracy of reporting of early pregnancy behaviors varied based on exposure. Overall, women who had abstained from a behavior were more likely to be classified correctly. Sensitivity of reporting was 0.14 for antibiotics, 0.30 for wine, 0.71 for brewed coffee, and 0.82 for vitamins. Most misclassification at follow-up was due to false-negative reporting. Among women who gave birth to singletons, 94\% could report their child's correct birthweight within 1/2 pound and 86\% could report duration of pregnancy within 7 days at follow-up. Conclusions: Self-report of prepregnancy weight, duration of pregnancy, and child's birthweight after almost 30 years was good, whereas self-reported pregnancy-related exposures resulted in higher levels of reporting error. Social desirability appeared to influence women's report of their behaviors at follow-up. Self-reported assessment of confidence in the recalled information was unrelated to accuracy.},

We conducted a linear regression analysis of the weight with month and year of birth, sex, maternal age, diabetes, and several meteorological factors as independent variables, which were also incorporated into multivariate logistic regression models to examine the effect of season of birth on the frequency of low birth weight (LBW, {$<$}2500 g) or macrosomia ({$>$}4000 g).\textbackslash n\textbackslash nRESULTS: A significant (P {$<$} .001) seasonal pattern in birth weights was observed, with a peak in July and a trough in January. Babies born in summer had an OR of 1.12 (95\% CI; 1.07 to 1.18) for macrosomia compared with those born in the winter. No such pattern was found for LBW.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSIONS: While in regions of mid-latitude, summer is associated with relatively lower birth weight, possibly because of exposure to cold temperature during early or mid-pregnancy, our data suggest that in Israel, the peak birth weight is in summer, possibly because of increased exposure to sunlight in the last weeks of the pregnancy.},

Methods: We carried out a pilot study of 51 first-grade children in southern Sichuan, China, using the fluoride concentration in morning urine after an exposure-free night; fluoride in well-water source; and dental fluorosis status as indices of past fluoride exposure. We administered a battery of age-appropriate, relatively culture-independent tests that reflect different functional domains: the Wide Range Assessment of Memory and Learning (WRAML), Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised (WISC-IV) digit span and block design; finger tapping and grooved pegboard. Confounder-adjusted associations between exposure indicators and test scores were assessed using multiple regression models. Results: Dental fluorosis score was the exposure indicator that had the strongest association with the outcome deficits, and the WISC-IV digit span subtest appeared to be the most sensitive outcome, where moderate and severe fluorosis was associated with a digit span total score difference of - 4.28 (95\% CI - 8.22, - 0.33) and backward score with - 2.13 (95\% CI - 4.24, - 0.02). Conclusions: This pilot study in a community with stable lifetime fluoride exposures supports the notion that fluoride in drinking water may produce developmental neurotoxicity, and that the dose-dependence underlying this relationship needs to be characterized in detail.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Cross-sectional research has suggested that television viewing may be associated with decreased attention spans in children. However, longitudinal data of early television exposure and subsequent attentional problems have been lacking. The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that early television exposure (at ages 1 and 3) is associated with attentional problems at age 7. METHODS: We used the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, a representative longitudinal data set. Our main outcome was the hyperactivity subscale of the Behavioral Problems Index determined on all participants at age 7. Children who were {$>$} or = 1.2 standard deviations above the mean were classified as having attentional problems. Our main predictor was hours of television watched daily at ages 1 and 3 years. RESULTS: Data were available for 1278 children at age 1 and 1345 children at age 3. Ten percent of children had attentional problems at age 7. In a logistic regression model, hours of television viewed per day at both ages 1 and 3 was associated with attentional problems at age 7 (1.09 [1.03-1.15] and 1.09 [1.02-1.16]), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Early television exposure is associated with attentional problems at age 7. Efforts to limit television viewing in early childhood may be warranted, and additional research is needed.},

Many different methods are used to recruit participants for such studies, but little is known about how various recruitment methods compare in terms of efficiency and costs. Objective: The aim of our study was to compare online and offline recruitment methods for Internet-based studies in terms of efficiency (number of recruited participants) and costs per participant. Methods: We employed several online and offline recruitment methods to enroll 18- to 45-year-old women in an Internet-based Danish prospective cohort study on fertility. Offline methods included press releases, posters, and flyers. Online methods comprised advertisements placed on five different websites, including Facebook and Netdoktor.dk. We defined seven categories of mutually exclusive recruitment methods and used electronic tracking via unique Uniform Resource Locator (URL) and self-reported data to identify the recruitment method for each participant. For each method, we calculated the average cost per participant and efficiency, that is, the total number of recruited participants. Results: We recruited 8252 study participants. Of these, 534 were excluded as they could not be assigned to a specific recruitment method. The final study population included 7724 participants, of whom 803 (10.4\%) were recruited by offline methods, 3985 (51.6\%) by online methods, 2382 (30.8\%) by online methods not initiated by us, and 554 (7.2\%) by other methods. Overall, the average cost per participant was \texteuro 6.22 for online methods initiated by us versus \texteuro 9.06 for offline methods. Costs per participant ranged from \texteuro 2.74 to \texteuro 105.53 for online methods and from \texteuro 0 to \texteuro 67.50 for offline methods. Lowest average costs per participant were for those recruited from Netdoktor.dk (\texteuro 2.99) and from Facebook (\texteuro 3.44). Conclusions: In our Internet-based cohort study, online recruitment methods were superior to offline methods in terms of efficiency (total number of participants enrolled). The average cost per recruited participant was also lower for online than for offline methods, although costs varied greatly among both online and offline recruitment methods. We observed a decrease in the efficiency of some online recruitment methods over time, suggesting that it may be optimal to adopt multiple online methods.},

  abstract = {Objectives: Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are risk factors for health problems later in life. This study aims to assess the influence of ACEs on risky health behaviors among mothers-to-be and determine whether a dose response occurs between ACEs and risky behaviors. Methods: A prospective survey of women attending health centers was conducted at the first prenatal care visit, and at 3 and 11 months postpartum. Surveys obtained information on maternal sociodemographic and health characteristics, and 7 ACEs prior to age 16. Risky behaviors included smoking, alcohol use, marijuana use, and other illicit drug use during pregnancy. Results: Our sample (N = 1476) consisted of low-income (mean annual personal income, \$8272), young (mean age, 24 years), African American (71\%), single (75\%) women. Twenty-three percent of women reported smoking even after finding out they were pregnant, 7\% reported alcohol use, and 7\% reported illicit drug use during pregnancy. Nearly three fourths (72\%) had one or more ACEs. There was a higher prevalence of each risky behavior among those exposed to each ACE than among those unexposed. The exception was alcohol use during pregnancy, where there was not an increased risk among those exposed when compared with those unexposed to witnessing a shooting or having a guardian in trouble with the law or in jail. The adjusted odds ratio for each risky behavior was {$>$}2.5 for those with {$>$}3 ACEs when compared with those without. Conclusions: ACEs were associated with risky health behaviors reported by mothers-to-be. Greater efforts should target the prevention of ACEs to lower the risk for adverse health behaviors that have serious consequences for adults and their children.

In particular, we introduce two novel sensitivity measures suited for routine reporting. The robustness value describes the minimum strength of association that unobserved confounding would need to have, both with the treatment and with the outcome, to change the research conclusions. The partial R2 of the treatment with the outcome shows how strongly confounders explaining all the residual outcome variation would have to be associated with the treatment to eliminate the estimated effect. Next, we offer graphical tools for elaborating on problematic confounders, examining the sensitivity of point estimates and t-values, as well as `extreme scenarios'. Finally, we describe problems with a common `benchmarking' practice and introduce a novel procedure to bound the strength of confounders formally on the basis of a comparison with observed covariates. We apply these methods to a running example that estimates the effect of exposure to violence on attitudes toward peace.},

The authors systematically review the peer-reviewed literature from around the world considering the association between educational attainment and obesity. Databases from public health and medicine, education, psychology, economics, and other social sciences were searched, and articles published in English, French, Portuguese and Spanish were included. This paper includes 289 articles that report on 410 populations in 91 countries. The relationship between educational attainment and obesity was modified by both gender and the country's economic development level: an inverse association was more common in studies of higher-income countries and a positive association was more common in lower-income countries, with stronger social patterning among women. Relatively few studies reported on lower-income countries, controlled for a comprehensive set of potential confounding variables and/or attempted to assess causality through the use of quasi-experimental designs. Future research should address these gaps to understand if the relationship between educational attainment and obesity may be causal, thus supporting education policy as a tool for obesity prevention.},

Study design A prospective study. TEG indices were evaluated in 23 women who underwent controlled ovarian stimulation for IVF at four points in time: 1. At the beginning of the cycle (corresponding to the lowest levels of E2), 2. On the day of hCG administration (maximal stimulation with highest E2 levels), 3. On the day of ovum pickup and 4. At the first pregnancy test (approximately 14~days after ovum pickup). The main outcome measures were TEG indices including R-time (time until initial fibrin formation), K-time (time until a 20~mm amplitude is achieved), {$\alpha$} angle (the rate of clot formation), Maximum Amplitude (MA, strength of the fibrin clot), Coagulation Index (CI, calculated overall indicator of coagulation) and LY30 (the decrease in graph amplitude). Results R, K, {$\alpha$} angle, MA and CI before hCG administration and at the time of the first pregnancy test were significantly higher compared to the baseline measurement before gonadotropins administration. No correlation was found between E2 and TEG indices. Conclusion Ovarian stimulation is associated with prolonged increased coagulability that extends after the time of maximal ovarian stimulation. The lack of association between E2 levels and TEG indices suggest that additional factors may play a role in the pathogenesis of increased coagulability in women with ovarian stimulation.},

In the industrial zone of Marseille, there is a long history of pollution, but little is known about the health implications. This study documented the prevalence of different health issues in two heavily polluted towns in the industrial zone using a CBPR approach. Subject and methods: This study used a CBPR approach and epidemiologic methods to answer community members' questions about the health of residents in Marseille's industrial zone by randomly sampling a cross-section of residents to systematically document health issues in Fos-sur-Mer and Port-Saint-Louis-du-Rh\^one, two towns in the industrial port area of Marseille, France. Results: Many chronic illnesses were elevated in these communities, as compared to regional and national prevalences, including chronic skin problems, asthma, cancer, and diabetes. Chronic skin problems and asthma were among the most common chronic illnesses reported. A majority of respondents also reported acute symptoms that affected daily life, including eye irritation or nose and throat problems. Conclusion: There is likely an environmental explanation for why, even after direct standardization, the prevalences of many diseases were higher in these communities than elsewhere. The combination of CBPR and rigorous epidemiologic methods helps make our findings relevant to both community members and researchers.},

  abstract = {The method of inverse probability weighting (henceforth, weighting) can be used to adjust for measured confounding and selection bias under the four assumptions of consistency, exchangeability, positivity, and no misspecification of the model used to estimate weights. In recent years, several published estimates of the effect of time-varying exposures have been based on weighted estimation of the parameters of marginal structural models because, unlike standard statistical methods, weighting can appropriately adjust for measured time-varying confounders affected by prior exposure. As an example, the authors describe the last three assumptions using the change in viral load due to initiation of antiretroviral therapy among 918 human immunodeficiency virus-infected US men and women followed for a median of 5.8 years between 1996 and 2005. The authors describe possible tradeoffs that an epidemiologist may encounter when attempting to make inferences. For instance, a tradeoff between bias and precision is illustrated as a function of the extent to which confounding is controlled. Weight truncation is presented as an informal and easily implemented method to deal with these tradeoffs. Inverse probability weighting provides a powerful methodological tool that may uncover causal effects of exposures that are otherwise obscured. However, as with all methods, diagnostics and sensitivity analyses are essential for proper use.},

The target population was US people infected with HIV in 2006, as estimated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Results from the trial apply, albeit muted by 12\%, to the target population, under the assumption that the authors have measured and correctly modeled the determinants of selection that reflect heterogeneity in the treatment effect. In simulations with a heterogeneous treatment effect, a conventional intent-to-treat estimate was biased with poor confidence limit coverage, but the proposed estimate was largely unbiased with appropriate confidence limit coverage.

Chrysotile asbestos exposure was measured in fiber-years per milliliter of air, and annual occupational exposures were estimated on the basis of detailed work histories. Sixteen percent of person-years involved exposure to asbestos, with a median exposure of 3.30 fiber-years/mL among those exposed. Lung cancer mortality by age 90 years under the observed asbestos exposure was 9.44\%. In comparison with observed asbestos exposure, if the facility had operated under the current Occupational Safety and Health Administration asbestos exposure standard of {$<$}0.1 fibers/mL, we estimate that the cohort would have experienced 24\% less lung cancer mortality by age 90 years (mortality ratio = 0.76, 95\% confidence interval: 0.62, 0.94). A further reduction in asbestos exposure to a standard of {$<$}0.05 fibers/mL was estimated to have resulted in a minimal additional reduction in lung cancer mortality by age 90 years (mortality ratio = 0.75, 95\% confidence interval: 0.61, 0.92).},

Here we provide a primer on maximum likelihood and some important extensions which have proven useful in epidemiologic research, and which reveal connections between maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods. For a given data set and probability model, maximum likelihood finds values of the model parameters that give the observed data the highest probability. As with all inferential statistical methods, maximum likelihood is based on an assumed model and cannot account for bias sources that are not controlled by the model or the study design. Maximum likelihood is nonetheless popular, because it is computationally straightforward and intuitive and because maximum likelihood estimators have desirable large-sample properties in the (largely fictitious) case in which the model has been correctly specified. Here, we work through an example to illustrate the mechanics of maximum likelihood estimation and indicate how improvements can be made easily with commercial software. We then describe recent extensions and generalizations which are better suited to observational health research and which should arguably replace standard maximum likelihood as the default method.},

However, much of the empirical evidence regarding the effects of breastfeeding on long-term child health and wellbeing does not adequately address the high degree of selection into breastfeeding. To address this important shortcoming, we employ sibling comparisons in conjunction with 25 years of panel data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) to approximate a natural experiment and more accurately estimate what a particular child's outcome would be if he/she had been differently fed during infancy. Results from standard multiple regression models suggest that children aged 4 to 14 who were breast- as opposed to bottle-fed did significantly better on 10 of the 11 outcomes studied. Once we restrict analyses to siblings and incorporate within-family fixed effects, estimates of the association between breastfeeding and all but one indicator of child health and wellbeing dramatically decrease and fail to maintain statistical significance. Our results suggest that much of the beneficial long-term effects typically attributed to breastfeeding, per se, may primarily be due to selection pressures into infant feeding practices along key demographic characteristics such as race and socioeconomic status. \textcopyright{} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

The variation in monthly preterm birth rates ranged from a trough of 64\% in May to a peak of 144\% in September. This is considerably greater seasonal variation than found in most previous studies, which used differing definitions of prematurity. The seasonal trend was present for maternal age groups 22\textendash 26 years (p{$<$}0.005) and greater than 26 years (p{$<$}0.005), for Bureau of the Census socioeconomic index 3.6\textendash 4.9 (p{$<$}10-4) and greater than 4.9 (p{$<$}0.01), for those living in northern states (p{$<$}10-4) for married gravidas (p{$<$}10-6) for blacks (p{$<$}0.05) and whites (p{$<$}0.001), but not for those less than age 22, those with socioeconomic index less than 3.6, those living in southern states, and those not married. Thus, preterm birth was seasonal in the population studied, and the seasonal factor was more evident in demographic groups less predisposed to deliver preterm.

The consistency of all the epidemiologic and experimental evidence also supports the conclusion of a causal relationship with cigarette smoking, while there are serious incon- sistencies in reconciling the evidence with other hypotheses which have been advanced.

  abstract = {Cause-and-effect relations are one of the most valuable types of knowledge sought after throughout the data-driven sciences since they translate into stable and generalizable explanations as well as efficient and robust decision-making capabilities. Inferring these relations from data, however, is a challenging task. Two of the most common barriers to this goal are known as confounding and selection biases. The former stems from the systematic bias introduced during the treatment assignment, while the latter comes from the systematic bias during the collection of units into the sample. In this paper, we consider the problem of identifiability of causal effects when both confounding and selection biases are simultaneously present. We first investigate the problem of identifiability when all the available data is biased. We prove that the algorithm proposed by [Bareinboim and Tian, 2015] is, in fact, complete, namely, whenever the algorithm returns a failure condition, no identifiability claim about the causal relation can be made by any other method. We then generalize this setting to when, in addition to the biased data, another piece of external data is available, without bias. It may be the case that a subset of the covariates could be measured without bias (e.g., from census). We examine the problem of identifiability when a combination of biased and unbiased data is available. We propose a new algorithm that subsumes the current state-of-the-art method based on the back-door criterion.},

  abstract = {Some of the most prominent results in causal inference have been developed in the context of atomic interventions, following the semantics of the do-operator and the inferential power of do-calculus. In practice, however, many real-world settings call for more complex types of treatments that cannot be represented by a simple atomic intervention. In this paper, we investigate a general class of interventions that covers some non-trivial types of policies (including conditional and stochastic), going beyond the atomic case. Our goal is to develop a general understanding and formal machinery to reason about the effects of those policies, similar to the robust theory developed to handle the atomic case. Specifically, we introduce a new set of inference rules (akin to do-calculus) that can be used to derive claims about general interventions, which we call {$\sigma$}-calculus. We develop a graph-based, efficient procedure for finding estimands of the effect of general policies as a function of the available observational and experimental distributions. We then prove that our algorithm and {$\sigma$}calculus are both sound for the tasks of identification (Pearl, 1995) and z-identification (Bareinboim and Pearl, 2012) under this class of interventions.},

  abstract = {A dynamic treatment regimen is a rule or set of rules which define how a subject's treatment at repeated visits depends on their evolving history of time-dependent covariates. In this manuscript we focus on regimens that are characterized by intermediate target ranges [b\textbackslash n1,b\textbackslash n2] which are used clinically to modify treatment such that longitudinal measures of the intermediate stay within a tolerance defined by [b\textbackslash n1,b\textbackslash n2]. For observational data, survival under a particular regimen can be consistently estimated by artificially censoring subjects when they become nonadherent to the regimen and then weighting subjects by the inverse probability of remaining uncensored. In many settings subjects are not identified at baseline as individuals who are following a pre-specified regimen. In addition, it may be possible for subjects to be adherent to multiple regimens at the same time. In order to compare alternative regimens we present a data augmentation methodology in which regimen membership is stochastically imputed multiple times and parameter estimates are aggregated to provide a final point estimate of a causal hazard ratio, and for which sandwich variance estimation methods provide consistent inference. The method is illustrated through simulation results as well as a preliminary analysis comparing epoetin therapy regimens with different target hemoglobin ranges in a cohort of hemodialysis subjects from the United States Renal Data System. \textcopyright{} 2011 International Chinese Statistical Association.},

  abstract = {American Indians living in Michigan experience disproportionately high rates of infant mortality. This 11-year (1998-2008) cohort study evaluated impacts of a Healthy Start (HS) program administered by the Inter-Tribal Council of Michigan (ITCM) on perinatal outcomes. Women who enrolled in ITCM's HS program ("exposed") were compared with non-enrolled ("unexposed") for four outcomes: low birth weight (LBW), small for gestational age, preterm birth, and inadequate prenatal care. To classify exposed and unexposed women and their children, Michigan vital records data were linked with HS enrollment records to identify participants and non-participants among all American Indian births. Logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios for the four outcomes of interest. Analyses were stratified for high and low access to care based on Medically Underserved Area (MUA) designation for a woman's county of residence. Of 4,149 American Indian births during the period, 872 were to women who enrolled prenatally in HS. Although unstratified analysis showed no differences between HS participants and non-participants, stratified analyses demonstrated that participants from MUA counties had decreased odds of LBW and inadequate prenatal care. Results suggest that in MUA counties where participants and non-participants are at similar risk for poor outcomes, HS may be reducing barriers and improving outcomes. In non-MUA counties participants had similar outcomes as non-participants. These results may reflect a wider disparity in risk factors between the two groups in non-MUA counties. The complex interplay among need, access, and benefit complicates analyses and suggests the importance of more in-depth and focused studies.},

We assessed the validity of United States (US)-based norms for the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development-III (BSID-III), a neurodevelopmental tool developed for and commonly used in the US, in Malawian children.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nMETHODS: We constructed BSID-III norms for cognitive, fine motor (FM), gross motor (GM), expressive communication (EC) and receptive communication (RC) subtests using 5173 tests scores in 167 healthy Malawian children. Norms were generated using Generalized Additive Models for location, scale and shape, with age modeled continuously. Standard z-scores were used to classify neurodevelopmental delay. Weighted kappa statistics were used to compare the classification of neurological development using US-based and Malawian norms.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nRESULTS: For all subtests, the mean raw scores in Malawian children were higher than the US normative scores at younger ages (approximately {$<$}6 months) after which the mean curves crossed and the US normative mean exceeded that of the Malawian sample and the age at which the curves crossed differed by subtest. Weighted kappa statistics for agreement between US and Malawian norms were 0.45 for cognitive, 0.48 for FM, 0.57 for GM, 0.50 for EC, and 0.44 for RC.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSION: We demonstrate that population reference curves for the BSID-III differ depending on the origin of the population. Reliance on US norm-based standardized scores resulted in misclassification of the neurological development of Malawian children, with the greatest potential for bias in the measurement of cognitive and language skills.},

  abstract = {In the disease of endometriosis, endometrial tissue grows outside the uterus, usually in the peritoneal cavity. Rodent models of endometriosis allow a way to reproduce the disease, evaluate effects of chemicals, and study mechanisms. Twenty-one days prior to induction surgery which produces endometriosis, female Sprague-Dawley rats and B6C3F1 mice were pretreated with 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) at 0, 3 or 10 micrograms TCDD/kg. Animals were treated again at the time of surgery and at 3, 6, and 9 weeks following surgery. Evaluations were made at 3, 6, 9, and 12 weeks postsurgery. TCDD produced a dose-dependent increase in endometriotic site diameter when all time points were pooled within each dose in rats and a dramatic increase in site diameter in mice at 9 and 12 weeks. In rats but not mice, ovarian weight was decreased at 9 and 12 weeks, the occurrence of persistent vaginal estrus was increased at these times, and histological evaluation of the ovaries revealed ovulatory arrest at 12 weeks. In both species, thymic antrophy, indicating immune dysfunction, and hepatomegaly were observed as consequences of TCDD exposure. Body weight was reduced in rats but not in mice. Histological evaluations of endometriotic sites revealed fibrosis in control rats, necrotic and inflammatory changes in the sites from TCDD-treated rats, and predominantly fibrotic changes in sites from TCDD-treated mice. Differences observed between the rat and the mouse with respect to (a) the magnitude of the effect on endometrial site diameter (rats {$<$} mice), (b) measured effects on ovarian function (rats {$>$} mice) that may be based on the partial antiestrogenicity of TCDD, and (c) evidence that mice and rats differ in their immune response to TCDD suggest that the mechanisms mediating TCDD's action to promote endometriosis are complex and may be different in rats and mice. The mouse may be a better model for future studies necessary to elucidate these mechanisms.},

  abstract = {A large literature describes relationships between month of birth, birth weight, and gestation. These relationships are hypothesized to reflect the causal impact of seasonal environmental factors. However, recent work casts doubt on this interpretation by showing that mothers with lower socioeconomic status are more likely to give birth in months that are associated with poorer birth outcomes. Seasonality in the numbers of conceptions in different months can also induce a mechanical correlation between preterm birth and month of birth. This paper analyzes the seasonality of health at birth using a large sample of 647,050 groups of US siblings representing 1,435,213 children. By following the same mother over time, we eliminate differences in fixed maternal characteristics as an explanation for seasonal differences in health at birth. We find a sharp trough in gestation length among babies conceived in May, which corresponds to an increase in prematurity of more than 10\%. Birth weight conditional on gestation length, however, is found to be strongly hump-shaped over the year, with 8-9 additional g for summer conceptions. We examine several potential mechanisms for explaining seasonality in birth outcomes that have generally been dismissed in the literature on seasonality in rich countries, notably disease prevalence and nutrition. The May trough in gestation length coincides with a higher influenza prevalence in January and February, when these babies are nearing full term, whereas the hump shape in birth weight is associated with a similar pattern in pregnancy weight gain.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The condition of obesity has become a significant public health problem in the United States. In children and adolescents, the prevalence of overweight has tripled in the last 20 years, with approximately 16.0\% of children ages 6-19, and 10.3\% of 2-5 year olds being considered overweight. Considerable research is underway to understand obesity in the general pediatric population, however little research is available on the prevalence of obesity in children with developmental disorders. The purpose of our study was to determine the prevalence of overweight among a clinical population of children diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD). METHODS: Retrospective chart review of 140 charts of children ages 3-18 years seen between 1992 and 2003 at a tertiary care clinic that specializes in the evaluation and treatment of children with developmental, behavioral, and cognitive disorders. Diagnostic, medical, and demographic information was extracted from the charts. Primary diagnoses of either ADHD or ASD were recorded, as was information on race/ethnicity, age, gender, height, and weight. Information was also collected on medications that the child was taking. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated from measures of height and weight recorded in the child's chart. The Center for Disease Control's BMI growth reference was used to determine an age- and gender-specific BMI z-score for the children. RESULTS: The prevalence of at-risk-for-overweight (BMI {$>$} 85th\%ile) and overweight (BMI {$>$} 95th\%ile) was 29\% and 17.3\% respectively in children with ADHD. Although the prevalence appeared highest in the 2-5 year old group (42.9\%ile), differences among age groups were not statistically significant. Prevalence did not differ between boys and girls or across age groups (all p {$>$} 0.05). For children with ASD, the overall prevalence of at-risk-for-overweight was 35.7\% and prevalence of overweight was 19\%. CONCLUSION: When compared to an age-matched reference population (NHANES 1999-2002), our estimates indicate that children with ADHD and with ASD have a prevalence of overweight that is similar to children in the general population.},

We propose IP weighting estimators that combine models for the probability of trial participation and the probability of treatment among trial participants. We show that, when all models are estimated using nonparametric frequency methods, these estimators are finite-sample equivalent to the g-formula estimator. We argue for the use of augmented IP weighting (doubly robust) generalizability estimators when nonparametric estimation is infeasible due to the curse of dimensionality, and examine the finite-sample behavior of different estimators using parametric models in a simulation study.},

We offer an interpretation of generalizability analyses using the notion of a hypothetical intervention to "scale-up" trial engagement to the target population. We consider the interpretation of generalizability analyses when trial engagement does or does not directly affect the outcome, highlight connections with censoring in longitudinal studies, and discuss identification of the distribution of counterfactual outcomes via g-formula computation and inverse probability weighting. Last, we show how the methods can be extended to address time-varying treatments, non-adherence, and censoring.},

  abstract = {When treatment effect modifiers influence the decision to participate in a randomized trial, the average treatment effect in the population represented by the randomized individuals will differ from the effect in other populations. In this tutorial, we consider methods for extending causal inferences about time-fixed treatments from a trial to a new target population of nonparticipants, using data from a completed randomized trial and baseline covariate data from a sample from the target population. We examine methods based on modeling the expectation of the outcome, the probability of participation, or both (doubly robust). We compare the methods in a simulation study and show how they can be implemented in software. We apply the methods to a randomized trial nested within a cohort of trial-eligible patients to compare coronary artery surgery plus medical therapy versus medical therapy alone for patients with chronic coronary artery disease. We conclude by discussing issues that arise when using the methods in applied analyses.},

We focused on the relation between the incarcerated parent's report of children's exposure to parental criminal activity, arrest, and sentencing and caregivers' and children's self-reports of maladjustment. Results indicate that witnessing these events is associated with more behavior problems according to caregivers' and children's self-reports. Moreover, incarcerated parents' reports of children's exposure to these events predicted caregivers' and children's reports of maladjustment over a 6 month period. Our results also suggest that children with incarcerated mothers, in comparison to children with incarcerated fathers, are exposed to more of these events and may be experiencing greater maladjustment. Implications of these findings are discussed within a proactive context and the use of procedures that take children's reactions to witnessing parental arrest and sentencing into consideration.

  abstract = {The effects of adrenal corticosteroids on subsequent adrenocorticotropin secretion are complex. Acutely (within hours), glucocorticoids (GCs) directly inhibit further activity in the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis, but the chronic actions (across days) of these steroids on brain are directly excitatory. Chronically high concentrations of GCs act in three ways that are functionally congruent. (i) GCs increase the expression of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) mRNA in the central nucleus of the amygdala, a critical node in the emotional brain. CRF enables recruitment of a chronic stress-response network. (ii) GCs increase the salience of pleasurable or compulsive activities (ingesting sucrose, fat, and drugs, or wheel-running). This motivates ingestion of "comfort food." (iii) GCs act systemically to increase abdominal fat depots. This allows an increased signal of abdominal energy stores to inhibit catecholamines in the brainstem and CRF expression in hypothalamic neurons regulating adrenocorticotropin. Chronic stress, together with high GC concentrations, usually decreases body weight gain in rats; by contrast, in stressed or depressed humans chronic stress induces either increased comfort food intake and body weight gain or decreased intake and body weight loss. Comfort food ingestion that produces abdominal obesity, decreases CRF mRNA in the hypothalamus of rats. Depressed people who overeat have decreased cerebrospinal CRF, catecholamine concentrations, and hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal activity. We propose that people eat comfort food in an attempt to reduce the activity in the chronic stress-response network with its attendant anxiety. These mechanisms, determined in rats, may explain some of the epidemic of obesity occurring in our society.},

  abstract = {Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are usually the preferred strategy with which to generate evidence of comparative effectiveness, but conducting an RCT is not always feasible. Though observational studies and RCTs often provide comparable estimates, the questioning of observational analyses has recently intensified because of randomized-observational discrepancies regarding the effect of postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy on coronary heart disease. Reanalyses of observational data that excluded prevalent users of hormone replacement therapy led to attenuated discrepancies, which begs the question of whether exclusion of prevalent users should be generally recommended. In the current study, the authors evaluated the effect of excluding prevalent users of statins in a meta-analysis of observational studies of persons with cardiovascular disease. The pooled, multivariate-adjusted mortality hazard ratio for statin use was 0.77 (95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.65, 0.91) in 4 studies that compared incident users with nonusers, 0.70 (95\% CI: 0.64, 0.78) in 13 studies that compared a combination of prevalent and incident users with nonusers, and 0.54 (95\% CI: 0.45, 0.66) in 13 studies that compared prevalent users with nonusers. The corresponding hazard ratio from 18 RCTs was 0.84 (95\% CI: 0.77, 0.91). It appears that the greater the proportion of prevalent statin users in observational studies, the larger the discrepancy between observational and randomized estimates. \textcopyright{} 2012 The Author.},

Study Design and Setting: Prospective observational study using electronic medical records of individuals aged 55\textendash 84 with coronary heart disease from {$>$}500 practices in the United Kingdom between 2000 and 2010. Results: The intention-to-treat mortality hazard ratio (95\% confidence interval) was 0.90 (0.84, 0.97) for statins vs. no treatment, 0.88 (0.73, 1.06) for statins plus antihypertensives vs. no treatment, and 0.91 (0.77, 1.06) for atorvastatin vs. simvastatin.

In doing so, we formally extend the back-door criterion of Pearl and others for use in incomplete data examples.

RESULTS: No relationship was found between depressive symptoms and body mass index. However, perception of weight as either underweight or overweight was related to higher depressive symptoms. The risk profile for reporting depressive symptoms includes use of any weight control strategies, female, and perception of weight. DISCUSSION: These findings underscore the importance of addressing adolescents' perceptions of weight in relation to their actual body mass index and psychological well-being.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: A strength of time-series analyses is the inherent control of individual-level risk factors that do not vary temporally. However, in studies of adverse pregnancy outcomes, risk factors considered time-invariant at the individual level may vary seasonally when aggregated into a pregnancy risk set. To illustrate, we describe the seasonal patterns of birth in Atlanta and demonstrate how these patterns could lead to confounding in time-series studies of seasonally-varying exposures and preterm birth. METHODS: The study cohort included all births in 20-county metropolitan Atlanta delivered during the period 1994-2004 (n = 715,875). We assessed the seasonal patterns of estimated conception and birth for the full cohort and for subgroups stratified by sociodemographic factors. Based on the observed patterns, we quantified the degree of potential confounding created by (1) differences in the gestational age distribution in the risk set across calendar months and (2) differences in the sociodemographic composition of the risk set across calendar months. RESULTS: The overall seasonal pattern of birth was characterized by a peak in August-September and troughs in April-May and November-January. Seasonal patterns differed among racial and ethnic groups, maternal education levels, and marital status. As a consequence of these seasonal patterns, systematic seasonal differences in the gestational age distribution and the sociodemographic composition of the risk set led to differences in expected rates of preterm birth across calendar months. CONCLUSIONS: Time-series investigations of seasonally-varying exposures and adverse pregnancy outcomes should consider the potential for bias due to seasonal heterogeneity in the risk set.},

DESIGN: Prospective study design: multivariate regression models examining the association between changes in overweight status and school outcomes between kindergarten entry and end of third grade, after controlling for various child, family and school characteristics. SUBJECTS: Nationally representative sample of US children who entered kindergarten in 1998, with longitudinal data on body mass index (BMI) and school outcomes at kindergarten entry and end of third grade. MEASUREMENTS: Wide range of elementary school outcomes collected in each wave including academic achievement (math and reading standardized test scores); teacher reported internalizing and externalizing behavior problems (BP), social skills (self-control, interpersonal skills) and approaches to learning; school absences; and grade repetition. Measurements of height and weight in each wave were used to compute BMI and indicators of overweight status based on CDC growth charts. A rich set of control variables capturing child, family, and school characteristics. RESULTS: Moving from not-overweight to overweight between kindergarten entry and end of third grade was significantly associated (P{$<$}0.05) with reductions in test scores, and teacher ratings of social-behavioral outcomes and approaches to learning among girls. However, this link was mostly absent among boys, with two exceptions - boys who became overweight had significantly fewer externalizing BPs (P{$<$}0.05), but more absences from school compared to boys who remained normal weight. Being always-overweight was associated with more internalizing BP among girls but fewer externalizing BPs among boys. CONCLUSION: Change in overweight status during the first 4 years in school is a significant risk factor for adverse school outcomes among girls but not boys. Girls who become overweight during the early school years and those who start school being overweight and remain that way may need to be monitored carefully.},

Using twin fixed effects models, we find that the effects of birth weight on cognitive development are essentially constant through the school career; that these effects are very similar across a wide range of family backgrounds; and that they are invariant to measures of school quality. We conclude that the effects of poor neonatal health on adult outcomes are therefore set very early.},

Objectives The aim of this study was to summarize data linking fertility therapy with subsequent cardiovascular outcomes. Methods We systematically searched published reports for studies addressing the question ``does fertility therapy increase the risk of longer term cardiovascular outcomes?'' We included: 1) human studies; 2) case control, cohort, or randomized designs with 3) exposure to fertility therapy and 4) cardiovascular outcomes clearly reported; 5) presence of comparison group; 6) minimum 1-year follow-up; and 7) adjustment for age. Two independent reviewers screened abstracts, titles, and full texts, and assessed study quality. We used the DerSimonian and Laird random-effects models to pool hazard ratios (HRs) with 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) of the following outcomes: acute cardiac event; stroke; venous thromboembolism; hypertension; and diabetes mellitus, comparing women who received fertility therapy with those who did not. Results Six observational studies met inclusion criteria including 41,910 women who received fertility therapy and 1,400,202 women who did not. There was no increased risk of a cardiac event (pooled HR: 0.91; 95\% CI: 0.67 to 1.25; I2 = 36.6\%), or diabetes mellitus (pooled HR: 0.93; 95\% CI: 0.87 to 1.001; I2 = 0\%). Results were not pooled for hypertension (I2 = 95.0\%) and venous thromboembolism (I2 = 82.3\%). There was a trend toward higher risk of stroke (pooled HR: 1.25; 95\% CI: 0.96 to 1.63; I2 = 0\%). Conclusions The small number of studies and significant heterogeneity precludes definitive reassurance about the longer term cardiovascular safety of these treatments, particularly stroke. Future studies are needed to address ongoing knowledge gaps in this area.},

  abstract = {Background: A Zika virus epidemic emerged in northeast Brazil in 2015 and was followed by a striking increase in congenital microcephaly cases, triggering a declaration of an international public health emergency. This is the final report of the first case-control study evaluating the potential causes of microcephaly: congenital Zika virus infection, vaccines, and larvicides. The published preliminary report suggested a strong association between microcephaly and congenital Zika virus infection. Methods: We did a case-control study in eight public maternity hospitals in Recife, Brazil. Cases were neonates born with microcephaly, defined as a head circumference of 2 SD below the mean. Two controls without microcephaly were matched to each case by expected date of delivery and area of residence. We tested the serum of cases and controls and the CSF of cases for detection of Zika virus genomes with quantitative RT-PCR and for detection of IgM antibodies with capture-IgM ELISA. We also tested maternal serum with plaque reduction neutralisation assays for Zika and dengue viruses. We estimated matched crude and adjusted odds ratios with exact conditional logistic regression to determine the association between microcephaly and Zika virus infection. Findings: We screened neonates born between Jan 15 and Nov 30, 2016, and prospectively recruited 91 cases and 173 controls. In 32 (35\%) cases, congenital Zika virus infection was confirmed by laboratory tests and no controls had confirmed Zika virus infections. 69 (83\%) of 83 cases with known birthweight were small for gestational age, compared with eight (5\%) of 173 controls. The overall matched odds ratio was 73{$\cdot$}1 (95\% CI 13{$\cdot$}0-{$\infty$}) for microcephaly and Zika virus infection after adjustments. Neither vaccination during pregnancy or use of the larvicide pyriproxyfen was associated with microcephaly. Results of laboratory tests for Zika virus and brain imaging results were available for 79 (87\%) cases; within these cases, ten were positive for Zika virus and had cerebral abnormalities, 13 were positive for Zika infection but had no cerebral abnormalities, and 11 were negative for Zika virus but had cerebral abnormalities. Interpretation: The association between microcephaly and congenital Zika virus infection was confirmed. We provide evidence of the absence of an effect of other potential factors, such as exposure to pyriproxyfen or vaccines (tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis, measles and rubella, or measles, mumps, and rubella) during pregnancy, confirming the findings of an ecological study of pyriproxyfen in Pernambuco and previous studies on the safety of Tdap vaccine administration during pregnancy.

Methods The National Longitudinal Survey of Youth and the Children and Young Adults surveys are U.S.-based, ongoing longitudinal studies, initiated in 1979 and 1986, respectively. Mothers (n=2,952) reported pregnancy and child (n=5,660) developmental information at multiple time points. Child total, internalizing, and externalizing problems at ages 9\textendash 11 years were assessed using the Behavior Problems Index (BPI), collected biennially until 2012. Associations between prepregnancy BMI and child BPI outcomes were examined, as well as two- and three-way interactions by race and gender. Analyses were conducted in 2017. Results Boys whose mothers had higher prepregnancy weights exhibited higher total BPI and externalizing scores at ages 9\textendash 11 years versus those with normal-weight mothers. Boys with severely obese mothers had higher total BPI (mean difference=7.99, 95\% CI=3.53, 12.46) and externalizing (mean difference=5.77, 95\% CI=1.50, 10.04) scores. Prepregnancy underweight was associated with boys' higher total BPI (mean difference=2.34, 95\% CI=0.02, 4.66) and externalizing (mean difference=3.30, 95\% CI=0.69, 5.91); these associations were not significant in sensitivity analyses. No associations emerged for girls or internalizing problems. Two-way interactions by race and three-way interactions by race and gender were not significant. Conclusions Maternal prepregnancy weight was associated with BPI level among boys. Boys with severely obese mothers exhibited markedly higher behavioral problems at ages 9\textendash 11 years versus those with normal-weight mothers, regardless of race. Maintaining healthy prepregnancy weight may be important for preventing boys' deleterious behavior outcomes in middle childhood.},

DESIGN: Examination of the effect of breast feeding on cognitive ability and the impact of a range of potential confounders, in particular maternal IQ, within a national database. Additional analyses compared pairs of siblings from the sample who were and were not breast fed. The results are considered in the context of other studies that have also controlled for parental intelligence via meta-analysis. SETTING: 1979 US national longitudinal survey of youth. SUBJECTS: Data on 5475 children, the offspring of 3161 mothers in the longitudinal survey. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: IQ in children measured by Peabody individual achievement test. RESULTS: The mother's IQ was more highly predictive of breastfeeding status than were her race, education, age, poverty status, smoking, the home environment, or the child's birth weight or birth order. One standard deviation advantage in maternal IQ more than doubled the odds of breast feeding. Before adjustment, breast feeding was associated with an increase of around 4 points in mental ability. Adjustment for maternal intelligence accounted for most of this effect. When fully adjusted for a range of relevant confounders, the effect was small (0.52) and non-significant (95\% confidence interval -0.19 to 1.23). The results of the sibling comparisons and meta-analysis corroborated these findings. CONCLUSIONS: Breast feeding has little or no effect on intelligence in children. While breast feeding has many advantages for the child and mother, enhancement of the child's intelligence is unlikely to be among them.},

Methods: Data from the National Epidemiologic Survey of Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC) were analyzed. Logistic regression models examined the past-year likelihood for meeting diagnostic criteria for psychiatric disorders. Interactions between weight group and gender were utilized to determine whether associations were significantly different in men and women after adjusting for demographic characteristics. Results: First, consistent with previous NESARC analyses, the prevalence estimates of psychiatric disorders were higher among people of higher body mass index groups, regardless of gender. However, these patterns differed across genders. Both severely obese women and men, in comparison to normal weight respondents, were much more likely to meet criteria for affective and anxiety disorders, but these associations were significantly (1.5-2 times) stronger among women. For Axis II disorders, while there were very few associations between personality disorders and weight in men, among women increases in weight group were associated with increases in the likelihood of meeting criteria for a personality disorder. Conclusion: Weight and psychopathology appear more strongly associated in women than in men. While these data do not allow for identification of underlying mechanisms, they highlight the importance of assessing for psychopathology in overweight and obese patients, and suggest that weight management may be an important consideration in the treatment of psychiatric disorders. \textcopyright{} MBL Communications Inc.},

Graphical models represent assumptions about the conditional independencies among the variables.

We demonstrate how to read off such graphs whether consistent estimation of the association between exposure and outcome is possible.

  abstract = {A central question in causal inference with observational studies is the sensitivity of conclusions to unmeasured confounding. The classical Cornfield condition allows us to assess whether an unmeasured binary confounder can explain away the observed relative risk of the exposure on the outcome. It states that for an unmeasured confounder to explain away an observed relative risk, the association between the unmeasured confounder and the exposure and the association between the unmeasured confounder and the outcome must both be larger than the observed relative risk. In this paper, we extend the classical Cornfield condition in three directions. First, we consider analogous conditions for the risk difference and allow for a categorical, not just a binary, unmeasured confounder. Second, we provide more stringent thresholds that the maximum of the above-mentioned associations must satisfy, rather than weaker conditions that both must satisfy. Third, we show that all the earlier results on Cornfield conditions hold under weaker assumptions than previously used. We illustrate the potential applications by real examples, where our new conditions give more information than the classical ones.},

Of the 37 studies, 23 focused on prenatal cocaine exposure, and 14 focused on prenatal alcohol exposure; most studies relied on broadband measures such as the CBCL for the assessment of challenging behavior. Among the 37 studies, a clear role for the postnatal environment on developing challenging behaviors was evident; however, prenatal alcohol exposure showed a much clearer independent effect upon challenging behaviors than was noted in the prenatal cocaine studies. Additionally, only 3 of the 37 studies addressed interventions for challenging behaviors, each of which showed an improvement in child behavior or parent-child interactions. As researchers have continued to show the importance of the postnatal environment, it is likely that interventions addressing specific environmental risk factors will be helpful to reduce or prevent challenging behaviors among this population.},

  abstract = {Extant observational studies generally support the existence of a link between neighborhood context and health. However, estimating the causal impact of neighborhood effects from observational data has proven to be a challenge. Omission of relevant factors may lead to overestimating the effects of neighborhoods on health while inclusion of time-varying confounders that may also be mediators (e.g., income, labor force status) may lead to underestimation. Using longitudinal data from the 1990 to 2007 years of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, this study investigates the link between neighborhood poverty and overall mortality risk. A marginal structural modeling strategy is employed to appropriately adjust for simultaneous mediating and confounding factors. To address the issue of possible upward bias from the omission of key variables, sensitivity analysis to assess the robustness of results against unobserved confounding is conducted. We examine two continuous measures of neighborhood poverty \textendash{} single-point and a running average. Both were specified as piece-wise linear splines with a knot at 20 percent. We found no evidence from the traditional na\"ive strategy that neighborhood context influences mortality risk. In contrast, for both the single-point and running average neighborhood poverty specifications, the marginal structural model estimates indicated a statistically significant increase in mortality risk with increasing neighborhood poverty above the 20 percent threshold. For example, below 20 percent neighborhood poverty, no association was found. However, after the 20 percent poverty threshold is reached, each 10 percentage point increase in running average neighborhood poverty was found to increase the odds for mortality by 89 percent [95\% CI~=~1.22, 2.91]. Sensitivity analysis indicated that estimates were moderately robust to omitted variable bias.},

  abstract = {{$<$}h2{$>$}Abstract{$<$}/h2{$><$}h3{$>$}Objective{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}In clinical trials, the relative risk or risk ratio (RR) is a mainstay of reporting of the effect magnitude for an intervention. The RR is the ratio of the probability of an outcome in an intervention group to its probability in a control group. Thus the RR provides a measure of change in the likelihood of an event linked to a given intervention. This measure has been widely used because it is today considered a measure with `portability' across varying outcome prevalence, especially when the outcome is rare. It turns out however that there is a much more important problem with this ratio, and this paper aims to demonstrate this problem.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Methods{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}We used mathematical derivation to determine if the RR is a measure of effect magnitude alone (i.e. a larger absolute value always indicating a stronger effect) or not. We also used the same derivation to determine its relationship to prevalence of an outcome. We confirm the derivation results with a follow-up analysis of 140,620 trials scraped from the Cochrane.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Results{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}We demonstrate that the RR varies for reasons other than magnitude of the effect because it is a ratio of two posterior probabilities, both of which are dependent on baseline prevalence of an outcome. Additionally we demonstrate that the RR shifts towards its null value with increasing outcome prevalence. The shift towards the null happens regardless of the strength of the association between intervention and outcome. The odds ratio (OR), the other commonly used ratio, measures solely the effect magnitude and has no relationship to prevalence of an outcome in a study nor does it overestimate the RR as is commonly thought.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Conclusions{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}The results demonstrate the need to a) end the primary use of the RR in clinical trials and meta-analyses as its direct interpretation is not meaningful; b) replace the RR by the OR; and c) only use the post-intervention risk recalculated from the OR for any expected level of baseline risk in absolute terms for purposes of interpretation such as the number needed to treat. These results will have far reaching implications such as reducing misleading results from clinical trials and meta-analyses and ushering in a new era in the reporting of such trials or meta-analyses in practice.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Background: Mortality selection occurs when a non-random subset of a population of interest has died before data collection and is unobserved in the data. Mortality selection is of general concern in the social and health sciences, but has received little attention in genetic epidemiology. We tested the hypothesis that mortality selection may bias genetic association estimates, using data from the US-based Health and Retirement Study (HRS). Methods: We tested mortality selection into the HRS genetic database by comparing HRS respondents who survive until genetic data collection in 2006 with those who do not. We next modelled mortality selection on demographic, health and social characteristics to calculate mortality selection probability weights. We analysed polygenic score associations with several traits before and after applying inverse-probability weighting to account for mortality selection. We tested simple associations and time-varying genetic associations (i.e. gene-by-cohort interactions). Results: We observed mortality selection into the HRS genetic database on demographic, health and social characteristics. Correction for mortality selection using inverse probability weighting methods did not change simple association estimates. However, using these methods did change estimates of gene-by-cohort interaction effects. Correction for mortality selection changed gene-by-cohort interaction estimates in the opposite direction from increased mortality selection based on analysis of HRS respondents surviving through 2012. Conclusions: Mortality selection may bias estimates of gene-by-cohort interaction effects. Analyses of HRS data can adjust for mortality selection associated with observables by including probability weights. Mortality selection is a potential confounder of genetic association studies, but the magnitude of confounding varies by trait.},

Results from the new national monitoring network for PM2.5 make possible systematic research on health risks at national and regional scales. OBJECTIVES: To estimate risks of cardiovascular and respiratory hospital admissions associated with short-term exposure to PM2.5 for Medicare enrollees and to explore heterogeneity of the variation of risks across regions. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A national database comprising daily time-series data daily for 1999 through 2002 on hospital admission rates (constructed from the Medicare National Claims History Files) for cardiovascular and respiratory outcomes and injuries, ambient PM2.5 levels, and temperature and dew-point temperature for 204 US urban counties (population {$>$}200,000) with 11.5 million Medicare enrollees (aged {$>$}65 years) living an average of 5.9 miles from a PM2.5 monitor. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Daily counts of county-wide hospital admissions for primary diagnosis of cerebrovascular, peripheral, and ischemic heart diseases, heart rhythm, heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and respiratory infection, and injuries as a control outcome. RESULTS: There was a short-term increase in hospital admission rates associated with PM2.5 for all of the health outcomes except injuries. The largest association was for heart failure, which had a 1.28\% (95\% confidence interval, 0.78\%-1.78\%) increase in risk per 10-microg/m3 increase in same-day PM2.5. Cardiovascular risks tended to be higher in counties located in the Eastern region of the United States, which included the Northeast, the Southeast, the Midwest, and the South. CONCLUSION: Short-term exposure to PM2.5 increases the risk for hospital admission for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases.},

Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) of total stroke and its subtypes in relation to multivitamin use. During a median follow-up of 19.1 years, we identified 2087 deaths from stroke, including 1148 ischemic strokes and 877 hemorrhagic strokes. After adjustment for potential confounders, multivitamin use was associated with lower but borderline significant risk of death from total stroke (HR, 0.87; 95\% confidence interval, 0.76-1.01), primarily ischemic stroke (HR, 0.80; 95\% confidence interval, 0.63-1.01), but not hemorrhagic stroke (HR, 0.96; 95\% confidence interval, 0.78-1.18).

This incidence remained high even when the analysis was restricted to singleton babies. The present paper investigates possible risk factors for prematurity, low birthweight and small-for-gestational-age (SGA) in singleton IVF births. Thirteen per cent of singleton IVF babies were preterm, 11\% low birthweight and 17\% small-for-gestational-age. Analysis by multiple regression indicated that hypertension during pregnancy was an independent risk for preterm delivery, low birthweight and SGA, bleeding during pregnancy for preterm delivery, and the number of embryos transferred and the type of infertility for low birthweight. \textcopyright{} 1992 Oxford University Press.},

In addition to the short-term complications of obesity during pregnancy in both mother and child, it is now recognised that maternal obesity has long-term adverse outcomes for the health of her offspring in later life. Evidence from both animal and human studies indicates that maternal obesity increases the risk for the offspring in developing obesity and altering body composition in child- and adulthood and, additionally, it also has an impact on the offspring's cardiometabolic health with dysregulation of metabolism including glucose/insulin homoeostasis, and development of hypertension and vascular dysfunction. Potential mechanisms include effects on the development and function of adipose tissue, pancreas, muscle, liver, the vasculature and the brain. Further studies are required to elucidate the mechanisms underpinning the programming of disease risk in the offspring as a consequence of maternal obesity. The ultimate aim is to identify potential targets, which may be amenable to prevention or early intervention in order to improve the health of this and future generations.},

A matched case-control study was carried out in three regions of the United Kingdom over the period January 2001 through August 2003. For each case, three liveborn controls were matched by initial intended place of delivery, region, and maternal age. Maternal hair analysis provided independent verification of recreational drug use. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate mutually adjusted odds ratios. Estimates were revised using data from hair analysis. Statistically significant adjusted odds ratios for gastroschisis were associated with first-trimester use of 1) any recreational drug (odds ratio (OR) = 2.2, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.2, 4.3) and 2) vasoconstrictive recreational drugs (defined as cocaine, amphetamines, and ecstasy) (OR = 3.3, 95\% CI: 1.0, 10.5). Other significant exposures included aspirin use (OR = 20.4, 95\% CI: 2.2, 191.5), cigarette smoking (OR = 1.7, 95\% CI: 1.1, 2.6), and prior history of gynecologic infection/disease (OR = 2.6, 95\% CI: 1.2, 5.6). Recreational drug use is a significant risk factor for gastroschisis and is one of a constellation of potentially preventable exposures which include cigarette smoking, aspirin use, and history of gynecologic infection/disease. Maternal hair analysis proved an acceptable and valuable method of independently verifying recreational drug use.},

Design: A cross-sectional study. Setting: The study is based on the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa) and uses data from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway. Sample: Women participating in the MoBa for the first time, {$\geq$}18 years of age who responded to questions regarding childhood abuse and pregnancy planning (n = 76 197). Methods: Data were collected using questionnaires. We conducted analyses using modified Poisson regressions and the relative excess risks due to interaction (RERI). Sensitivity analyses were performed. Main outcome measure: An unplanned pregnancy (yes/no). Results: Exposure to childhood emotional (adjusted relative risk [RR] 1.14, 95\% CI 1.10\textendash 1.19), physical (adjusted RR 1.11, 95\% CI 1.04\textendash 1.18) and sexual (adjusted RR 1.20, 95\% CI 1.14\textendash 1.27) abuse increased the risk of having an unplanned pregnancy. The effects could not be explained by the collider stratification bias. The different combinations of categories of abuse did not show any interaction effects. Conclusions: Childhood emotional, physical and sexual abuses separately increase the risk of having an unplanned pregnancy.

This study examined the components of the surveillance in an attempt to discover the reasons for this discrepancy.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nMETHODS: Erie County and Monroe County were the 2 most populous counties included in the New York Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Surveillance Network. Erie County includes Buffalo, the second largest city in New York State, and Monroe County includes Rochester, the third largest city. Multiple sources of ascertainment included birth defect surveillance systems, genetic clinics, and early intervention programs. The case definition was based on the Institute of Medicine criteria of an abnormality in each of the following 3 areas: facial features, central nervous system, and growth.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nRESULTS: Children born in Erie County or Monroe County between 1995 and 1999 were included. The fetal alcohol syndrome prevalence rates in these 2 counties were 0.90 cases per 1000 births and 0.21 cases per 1000 births, respectively. The 2 counties were demographically similar and had similar rates of binge drinking among women of childbearing age. There was less participation in the surveillance system by sources in Monroe County. Erie County had a very active clinician with a specialized fetal alcohol syndrome clinic.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSIONS: The participation of clinicians in one county, especially one with expertise in fetal alcohol syndrome, was the most likely explanation for the differences in prevalence rates between the counties.},

  abstract = {Background Androgen-deprivation therapy in patients with prostate cancer who have relapsed with rising prostate-specific antigen concentration only (PSA-only relapse), or with non-curable but asymptomatic disease at diagnosis, could adversely affect quality of life at a time when the disease itself does not. We aimed to compare the effect of immediate versus delayed androgen-deprivation therapy on health-related quality of life over 5 years in men enrolled in the TOAD (Timing of Androgen Deprivation) trial. Methods This randomised, multicentre, open-label, phase 3 trial done in 29 public and private cancer centres across Australia, New Zealand, and Canada compared immediate with delayed androgen-deprivation therapy in men with PSA-only relapse after definitive treatment, or de-novo non-curable disease. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) with a database-embedded, dynamically balanced algorithm to immediate androgen-deprivation therapy (immediate therapy group) or to delayed androgen-deprivation therapy (delayed therapy group). Any type of androgen-deprivation therapy was permitted, as were intermittent or continuous schedules. The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) quality-of-life questionnaires QLQ-C30 and PR25 were completed before randomisation, every 6 months for 2 years, and annually for a further 3 years. The primary outcome of the trial, reported previously, was overall survival, with global health-related quality of life at 2 years as a secondary endpoint. Here we report prespecified secondary objectives of the quality-of-life endpoint. Analysis was by intention to treat. Statistical significance was set at p=0{$\cdot$}0036.

  abstract = {The last few decades have seen the Structural Causal Model framework provide valuable tools to assess causal effects from observational data. In this article, we briefly review recent results regarding the recoverability of causal effects from selection biased data, and apply them to the case of responsibility analyses in road safety epidemiology. Our objective is to formally determine which effects can be unbiasedly estimated through this type of analyses, depending on available data. We consider the estimation of the causal effect of alcohol in two situations. First, when data are available for all types of crashes, we show that the causal odds-ratio of alcohol on the responsibility to trigger a car accident can be approximated under some assumptions. However, available data most often depends on the accident severity, which is related to speed. In this case, the causal odds-ratio of alcohol is not recoverable. We present numerical results to illustrate our arguments and the magnitude of the bias. We finally show that this bias makes association measures not only externally, but also internally invalid.},

The hypothesized model was revised; the revised model was cross validated on a split-half sample, and estimated separately by age group, gender, and race/ethnicity.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nRESULTS: The revised model fit the data well and was supported by cross-validation. Poverty, maternal birth age, parents' education, maternal depression, and marital conflict were directly or indirectly related to mothers' frequent use of physical punishment. Frequent use of physical punishment was directly related to children's socioemotional problems, as were maternal depression and marital conflict. Few subgroup differences were found.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSIONS: Main findings indicate that the effect of poverty on mothers' use of physical punishment is indirect, and is mediated by maternal depression and marital conflict. Depressed mothers spank their children more frequently and experience higher levels of marital conflict, which, in turn, is directly related to their use of physical punishment. Younger, more educated mothers spank their children less often. Children who are spanked more frequently exhibit more socioemotional problems.},

  abstract = {Genetic association studies have identified important risk factors for Alzheimer's disease and other diseases. However, the ease with which these methods can be applied and the shear number of polymorphisms in the human genome has led to a well-characterized multiple comparison problem - given the number of genetic variants being tested, it is likely that many of the positive findings reported in the literature to date will prove to be false positive findings explained simply by random fluctuation in data and type I error. The disparity of findings in initial positive reports versus subsequent negative replication studies observed in the Alzheimer's disease literature underscores this problem. The problem of a high false positive rate can be addressed in part by using statistical correction for multiple comparisons in larger and statistically more powerful samples and in meta-analyses of smaller samples. National initiatives are now being considered to address this problem by encouraging sharing of genetic material. Of equal concern in planning future initiatives are methodological issues that are the domain of the epidemiologist. In fact, it is possible that disparate findings across case-control studies reported to date may be explained in part by problems in the design, analysis and interpretation of these studies. The involvement of epidemiologists may improve the situation in this regard. For example, population stratification bias, control selection bias and prevalent case bias can be minimized by careful study design and by appropriate statistical analysis. Regarding interpretation of case-control studies, a more careful consideration of the strength of evidence for a given genetic variant may help to temper enthusiasm for, or appropriately qualify, positive findings. Epidemiologists have well-developed causal criteria for this purpose. This paper reviews the current state of case-control studies of genetic variants in Alzheimer's disease from the epidemiological perspective. The problem of multiple comparisons and a high false positive rate is reviewed. The potential for bias in case-control studies of Alzheimer's disease is reviewed by way of example. Future initiatives to promote case-control studies of genetic variants in Alzheimer's disease can only benefit from increased awareness the tools of epidemiology.

Underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. We performed a global gene expression analysis of mid-trimester amniotic fluid cell-free fetal RNA in obese versus lean pregnant women.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nMETHODS: This prospective pilot study included eight obese (BMI{$\geq$}30) and eight lean (BMI{$<$}25) women undergoing clinically indicated mid-trimester genetic amniocentesis. Subjects were matched for gestational age and fetal sex. Fetuses with abnormal karyotype or structural anomalies were excluded. Cell-free fetal RNA was extracted from amniotic fluid and hybridized to whole genome expression arrays. Genes significantly differentially regulated in 8/8 obese-lean pairs were identified using paired t-tests with the Benjamini-Hochberg correction (false discovery rate of {$<$}0.05). Biological interpretation was performed with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis and the BioGPS gene expression atlas.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nRESULTS: In fetuses of obese pregnant women, 205 genes were significantly differentially regulated. Apolipoprotein D, a gene highly expressed in the central nervous system and integral to lipid regulation, was the most up-regulated gene (9-fold). Apoptotic cell death was significantly down-regulated, particularly within nervous system pathways involving the cerebral cortex. Activation of the transcriptional regulators estrogen receptor, FOS, and STAT3 was predicted in fetuses of obese women, suggesting a pro-estrogenic, pro-inflammatory milieu.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSION: Maternal obesity affects fetal neurodevelopmental and metabolic gene expression as early as the second trimester. These findings may have implications for postnatal neurodevelopmental and metabolic abnormalities described in the offspring of obese women.},

Results: The estimated 2-year risk of treatment initiation was 69\% if patients were censored at loss to follow up or 59\% if losses to follow up were treated as competing events. Using the proposed approach, we estimated that the 2-year risk of antiretroviral therapy initiation was 62\% (95\% confidence interval: 61, 62). The proposed approach had little bias and appropriate confidence interval coverage under scenarios examined in the simulation experiments. Conclusions: The proposed approach relaxes the assumptions inherent in treating loss to follow up as a censoring or competing event in clinical HIV cohort studies.},

  abstract = {Background: Several epidemiologic designs allow studying fecundability, the monthly probability of pregnancy occurrence in noncontracepting couples in the general population. These designs may, to varying extents, suffer from attenuation bias and other biases. We aimed to compare the main designs: incident and prevalent cohorts, pregnancy-based, and current duration approaches. Methods: A realistic simulation model produced individual reproductive lives of a fictitious population. We drew random population samples according to each study design, from which the cumulative probability of pregnancy was estimated. We compared the abilities of the designs to highlight the impact of an environmental factor influencing fecundability, relying on the Cox model with censoring after 12 or 6 months. Results: Regarding the estimation of the cumulative probability of pregnancy, the pregnancy-based approach was the most prone to bias. When we considered a hypothetical factor associated with a hazard ratio (HR) of pregnancy of 0.7, the estimated HR was in the 0.78-0.85 range, according to designs. This attenuation bias was largest for the prevalent cohort and smallest for the current duration approach, which had the largest variance. The bias could be limited in all designs by censoring durations at 6 months. Conclusion: Attenuation bias in HRs cannot be ignored in fecundability studies. Focusing on the effect of exposures during the first 6 months of unprotected intercourse through censoring removes part of this bias. For risk factors that can accurately be assessed retrospectively, retrospective fecundity designs, although biased, are not much more strongly so than logistically more intensive designs entailing follow-up.},

Items describing common behavioral and emotional problems in this population were generated by extracting descriptions from 664 case files of children and adolescents with behavior disorders seen at a specialist developmental assessment service over 12 years. These items were reduced to a set of 96 items administered to a sample of 1,093 children and adolescents with mental retardation and then submitted to a principal components analysis. Six interpretable and partly validated subscales were obtained which explained 36\% of the total variance and had satisfactory internal consistency. Interrater and test-retest agreement were satisfactory for both total scale score and for scores on each of the subscales. Good evidence of concurrent validity was provided by substantial positive correlations between total scores on the DBC completed by lay informants and the ratings of experienced psychiatrists based upon interviews and scores on two standardized instruments that must be completed by health professionals. The discriminative validity of the total score as assessed by area under the ROC curve was excellent (92\%). Standardized norms for the DBC are derived from an epidemiological study of behavior problems in children and adolescents with mental retardation undertaken in two Australian States. Norms are available for the mild, moderate, severe, and profound MR groups and for the MR population as a whole.},

This article introduces a purely graphical way of characterizing endogenous selection bias and of understanding its consequences ( Hern\'an et al. 2004 ). We use causal graphs (direct acyclic graphs, or DAGs) to highlight that endogenous selection bias stems from conditioning (e.g., controlling, stratifying, or selecting) on a so-called collider variable, i.e., a variable that is itself caused by two other variables, one that is (or is associated with) the treatment and another that is (or is associated with) the outcome. Endogenous selection bias can result from direct conditioning on the outcome variable, a post-outcome variable, a post-treatment variable, and even a pre-treatment variable. We highlight the difference between endogenous selection bias, common-cause confounding, and overcontrol bias and discuss numerous examples from social stratification, cultural sociology, social network analysis, political sociology, social demography, and the sociology of education.},

The objective of this study is to compare the relative importance of such maternal measures as determinants of birthweight of female infants-the prospective mothers of the next generation.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nMETHODS: The study base was derived from a population-based multiethnic intergenerational cohort: the Washington State Intergenerational Cohort. Infants of mothers from four ethnic groups were included: non-Hispanic Whites, African Americans, Native Americans, and Hispanics. We generated simple, partial, and multiple correlation coefficients to investigate the association between birthweight and the maternal growth and SES measures.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nRESULTS: While there were slight differences among the ethnic groups, generally each of three maternal pre-conceptional growth measures-birthweight, stature, and pre-pregnant weight-was a stronger predictor of female infant birthweight than were each of the five maternal SES factors-age, parity, marital status, educational attainment, and prenatal care onset. After accounting for the proportion of variation in birthweight explained by the maternal growth measures and maternal smoking, the addition of the five SES variables added relatively little to the prediction of infant birthweight. The maximal multiple correlation coefficients (R2) yield values ranging from 9.5\% to 12.8\%.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSIONS: A mother's growth before pregnancy is a stronger predictor of infant birthweight than is her current socio-economic circumstance. Since the mother's growth must have been influenced by the socio-economic circumstances of her family of upbringing, this further highlights the intergenerational contribution on a woman's reproductive success.},

  abstract = {IMPORTANCE Patients with cancer who use statins appear to have a substantially better survival than nonusers in observational studies. However, this inverse association between statin use and mortalitymay be due to selection bias and immortal-time bias. OBJECTIVE To emulate a randomized trial of statin therapy initiation that is free of selection bias and immortal-time bias. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS We used observational data on 17 372 patients with cancer from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database (2007-2009) with complete follow-up until 2011. The SEER-Medicare database links 17 US cancer registries and claims files from Medicare and Medicaid in 12 US states.We included individuals with a new diagnosis of colorectal, breast, prostate, or bladder cancer who had not been prescribed statins for at least 6 months before the cancer diagnosis. Individuals were duplicated, and each replicate was assigned to either the strategy "statin therapy initiation within 6 months after diagnosis" or "no statin therapy initiation." Replicates were censored when they stopped following their assigned strategy, and the potential selection bias was adjusted for via inverse-probability weighting. Hazard ratios (HRs), cumulative incidences, and risk differences were calculated for all-cause mortality and cancer-specific mortality.We then compared our estimates with those obtained using the same analytic approaches used in previous observational studies. EXPOSURES Statin therapy initiation within 6 months after cancer diagnosis. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Cancer-specific and all-cause mortality using SEER-Medicare data and data from previous studies. RESULTS Of the 17 372 patients whose data were analyzed, 8440 (49\%) were men, and 8932 (51\%) were women (mean [SD] age, 76.4 [7.4] years; range, 66-115 years). The adjusted HR (95\%CI) comparing statin therapy initiation vs no initiation was 1.00 (0.88-1.15) for cancer-specific mortality and 1.07 (0.93-1.21) for overall mortality. Cumulative incidence curves for both groups were almost overlapping (the risk difference never exceeded 0.8\%). In contrast, the methods used by prior studies resulted in an inverse association between statin use and mortality (pooled hazard ratio 0.69). CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE After usingmethods that are not susceptible to selection bias from prevalent users and to immortal time bias, we found that initiation of therapy with statins within 6 months after cancer diagnosis did not appear to improve 3-year cancer-specific or overall survival.},

  abstract = {The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), a ligand-activated transcription factor, contributes to carcinogenesis through its role in the regulation of cytochrome P450 1 (CYP1)-catalyzed metabolism of carcinogens. Here, we investigated genetic and epigenetic mechanisms that affect AhR expression. Analyses of the human AHR proximal promoter in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells using luciferase assays and electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed multiple specificity protein (Sp) 1 binding sequences that are transcriptional activators in vitro. The regulation of AhR expression was evaluated in long-term estrogen exposed (LTEE) MCF-7 cells, which showed increased AhR expression, enhanced CYP1 inducibility, and increased capacity to form DNA adducts when exposed to the dietary carcinogen, 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b] pyridine. The increased AhR expression in LTEE cells was found not to result from increased mRNA stability, differential RNA processing, or decreased DNA methylation. Analysis of the AHR proximal promoter region using chromatin immunoprecipitation confirmed that enhanced expression of AhR in LTEE cells involves changes in histone modifications, notably decreased trimethylation of histone 3, lysine 27. Upon further examination of the GC-rich Sp1-binding region, we confirmed that it contains a polymorphic (GGGGC) n repeat. In a population of newborns from New York State, the allele frequency of (GGGGC) n was n = 4 {$>$} 5 6, 2. Circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed the ability of sequences of this GC-rich region to form guanine-quadruplex structures in vitro. These studies revealed multiple levels at which AhR expression may be controlled, and offer additional insights into mechanisms regulating AhR expression that can ultimately impact carcinogenesis. \textcopyright{} 2012 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {High birth weight ({$>$}4.0 kg) has been associated with a wide range of health problems later in life. The interpretation of these statistical associations may be difficult, however. These difficulties are closely linked to methodological challenges in this research, such as filtering out confounding from family factors, disentangling associations with prenatal processes from associations with postnatal processes, and uncovering what birth weight actually represents. The well-conducted study by Kristensen et al. (Am J Epidemiol. 2014;180(9):876-884), presented in this issue of the Journal, offers an interesting example of how one can filter out confounding from family factors. In an elegant series of analyses, the authors show how an apparent inverse association between birth weight and later intelligence among those in the highest range of the birth weight scale became a positive association when proper adjustment for family factors was made. Sibling comparisons were important here.},

  abstract = {Assisted reproductive technologies (ART) offer revolutionary infertility treatments for millions of childless couples around the world. Currently, ART accounts for 1 to 3\% of annual births in industrialized countries and continues to expand rapidly. Except for an increased incidence of premature births, these technologies are considered safe. However, new evidence published during the past decade has suggested an increased incidence of imprinting disorders in children conceived by ART. Specifically, an increased risk was reported for Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS), Angelman syndrome (AS), Silver-Russell syndrome, and retinoblastoma. In contrast, some studies have found no association between ART and BWS, AS, Prader-Willi syndrome, transient neonatal diabetes mellitus, and retinoblastoma. The variability in ART protocols and the rarity of imprinting disorders complicate determining the causative relationship between ART and an increased incidence of imprinting disorders. Nevertheless, compelling experimental data from animal studies also suggest a link between increased imprinting disorders and ART. Further comprehensive, appropriately powered studies are needed to better address the magnitude of the risk for ART-associated imprinting disorders. Large longitudinal studies are particularly critical to evaluate long-term effects of ART not only during the perinatal period but also into adulthood. An important consideration is to determine if the implicated association between ART and imprinting disorders is actually related to the procedures or to infertility itself.

  abstract = {Endometriosis is a puzzling disease with little known about its true prevalence, its distribution in the population, or its risk factors. It is thought to be a relatively common disease, however, with an estimated prevalence among women of reproductive age as high as 10\%.90 Given this relatively high prevalence and that women with the disease may have severe pelvic pain and infertility, endometriosis poses a significant public health problem. It is the third leading cause of gynecologic hospitalizations in the United States and a leading cause of hysterectomy.84 In a cost analysis prepared by the US Army, endometriosis cost \$2.6 million over a 6-year period for time lost to service because of surgical hospitalization alone.10 This is an underestimate of the cost in the general population because women generally are ineligible for active duty if they have severe symptomatic endometriosis, and time lost from work for unhospitalized sick days could not be accounted for. In a recent analysis45 of women who participated in the US Health Interview Survey, 50\% of those reporting having endometriosis had stayed in bed all day because of their condition at some time in the past 12 months, with the average number of bed days being 17.8. Thus, this disease is costly in its effects on women's quality of life, the expense of medical care, and its economic impact in the workplace. This article summarizes present knowledge about the epidemiology of endometriosis. In this article well-designed and well-controlled studies are emphasized.},

Patient(s): Ninety women scheduled to undergo laparoscopy or laparotomy (study sample); 120 women who underwent laparoscopy (test sample). Intervention: The study sample group was interviewed before surgery about infertility and dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, and noncyclic pelvic pain and each member had a pelvic examination and a transvaginal ultrasound. At surgery, endometriosis was noted. For the test sample, the same information was abstracted from medical records after laparoscopy. Main Outcome Measure(s): The ability of symptoms, signs, and ultrasound to predict endometriosis at surgery. A classification tree was developed with the study sample and evaluated with the test sample. Result(s): Ovarian endometriosis, but not nonovarian endometriosis, could be reliably predicted with noninvasive tools. Ultrasound and examination best predicted ovarian endometriosis, correctly classifying 100\% of cases with no false positive diagnoses in the study sample. Similar results were found in the test sample. Conclusion(s): Noninvasive tools may be used to identify women with ovarian, but not nonovarian endometriosis, with excellent agreement with surgical diagnosis.},

We sought to determine whether dioxin exposure is associated with endometriosis in humans. We conducted a population-based historical cohort study 20 years after the 1976 factory explosion in Seveso, Italy, which resulted in the highest known population exposure to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-(italic)p(/italic)-dioxin (TCDD). Participants were 601 female residents of the Seveso area who were (3/4) 30 years old in 1976 and had adequate stored sera. Endometriosis disease status was defined by pelvic surgery, current transvaginal ultrasound, pelvic examination, and interview (for history of infertility and pelvic pain). "Cases" were women who had surgically confirmed disease or an ultrasound consistent with endometriosis. "Nondiseased" women had surgery with no evidence of endometriosis or no signs or symptoms. Other women had uncertain status. To assess TCDD exposure, individual levels of TCDD were measured in stored sera collected soon after the accident. We identified 19 women with endometriosis and 277 nondiseased women. The relative risk ratios (RRRs) for women with serum TCDD levels of 20.1-100 ppt and {$>$}100 ppt were 1.2 [90\% confidence interval (CI) = 0.3-4.5] and 2.1 (90\% CI = 0.5-8.0), respectively, relative to women with TCDD levels (3/4) 20 ppt. Tests for trend using the above exposure categories and continuous log TCDD were nonsignificant. In conclusion, we report a doubled, nonsignificant risk for endometriosis among women with serum TCDD levels of 100 ppt or higher, but no clear dose response. Unavoidable disease misclassification in a population-based study may have led to an underestimate of the true risk of endometriosis.},

However, this estimation can be grossly influenced by a selective loss to follow-up. Methods: We investigated the influence of health selection on the estimated age-associated cognitive function and decline by studying the effect on this estimation of study design and of the handling of multiple and missing data. We used linear regression analyses and linear mixed models to assess cognitive function from cross-sectional and longitudinal data. Repeated measures of cognitive function (assessed with dedicated neuropsychological tests) were carried out in 2 independent population-based cohort studies: the Rotterdam Study (3719 participants; mean age 71 years) and the Leiden 85-plus Study (369 participants; age 85 years). Results: The effect of age on cognitive function was greater in cross-sectional analyses when all participants were included than when analyses were restricted to participants with repeated measurements. The decline in cognitive function over 4.6 years of follow-up was intermediate between the cross-sectional estimates from the total sample and from the restricted sample. Moreover, the estimated decline in cognitive function was larger when using a short follow-up than when using the complete follow-up over 5 years. The estimated decline using linear mixed models was similar to analyses including those with a complete follow-up over 5 years. Conclusion: Selection for health and survival results in better age-specific cognitive test scores and less cognitive decline. Statistical methods handling multiple and missing data do not fully correct for this bias.},

Methods: In a study on the reproductive health of male partners of pregnant women, information was obtained from a group of men agreeing to collect a semen sample and to complete a questionnaire (group A), a group only completing the questionnaire (group B) and from men refusing to participate altogether (group C). Results: The participation rate (group A) was 15.8\% for 1409 men approached. Ages and socio-professional status were similar in the three groups. Time to pregnancy (TTP) was not significantly different in groups A and B, although there appeared to be an insignificantly higher proportion of couples taking longer than 12 months to conceive in group A than in group B. A history of urogenital disease appeared to be more frequent in groups A and B than in the general population. However, comparable semen characteristics were found for men with or without a history of urogenital disease. Pregnancy outcomes were similar in the three groups. Conclusions: The present study does not suggest major selection bias, although the social and reproductive histories of these men may prompt them to participate. Such factors need to be accounted for in similar studies. \textcopyright{} European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology 2004; all rights reserved.},

Eleven of the 13 contralateral cases had left sided diaphragmatic defects and right sided limb deficiency; four had de Lange syndrome and nine had other patterns of multiple anomalies. Only cases with Poland anomaly or otherwise isolated defects showed a trend towards ipsilateral defects. Most cases with multiple congenital anomalies, had limbs defects on both the right and left (57\%) or both sides of the diaphragm were affected (an additional 10\%), indicating a widespread dysmorphogenetic process rather than a more restricted field defect. In other cases, defects were bilateral or, if unilateral, reflected the propensities for diaphragmatic defects to more often involve the left side, and limb defects, the right.},

These assumptions are quite general and can easily be tested; they do not require pre-cise background knowledge of p(x) or p(w), such as proportions estimated from previous studies. We particularly consider conditional independence constraints, which often arise from graphical and causal models, although other constraints can also be used.

We introduce a new class of hyper-graphs, called mDAGs, and a latent projection operation to obtain an mDAG from the margin of a DAG.

This study assesses the extent and predictors of uptake of optimal doses of IPTp-SP in six districts of Tanzania.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nMETHODS: The data come from a cross-sectional survey of random households conducted in six districts in Tanzania in 2012. A total of 1,267 women, with children aged less than two years and who had sought antenatal care (ANC) at least once during pregnancy, were selected for the current analysis. Data analysis involved the use of Chi-Square ({$\chi$}2) for associations and multivariate analysis was performed using multinomial logistic regression.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nRESULTS: Overall, 43.6\% and 28.5\% of the women received optimal (two+) and partial (one) doses of IPTp-SP respectively during pregnancy. Having had been counseled on the dangers of malaria during pregnancy was the most pervasive determinant of both optimal (RRR\,=\,6.47, 95\% CI 4.66-8.97) and partial (RRR\,=\,4.24, 95\% CI 3.00-6.00) uptake of IPTp-SP doses. Early ANC initiation was associated with a higher likelihood of uptake of optimal doses of IPTp-SP (RRR\,=\,2.05, 95\% CI 1.18-3.57). Also, women with secondary or higher education were almost twice as likely as those who had never been to school to have received optimal SP doses during pregnancy (RRR\,=\,1.93, 95\% CI 1.04-3.56). Being married was associated with a 60\% decline in the partial uptake of IPTp-SP (RRR\,=\,0.40, 95\% CI 0.17-0.96). Inter-district variations in the uptake of both optimal and partial IPTp-SP doses existed (P\,{$<$}\,0.05).\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSION: Counseling to pregnant women on the dangers of malaria in pregnancy and formal education beyond primary school is important to enhance uptake of optimal doses of SP for malaria control in pregnancy in Tanzania. ANC initiation in the first trimester should be promoted to enhance coverage of optimal doses of IPTp-SP. Programmes should aim to curb geographical barriers due to place of residence to enhance optimal coverage of IPTp-SP in Tanzania.},

  abstract = {Internalizing problems in preschool have been found to predict later anxiety and depressive disorders, and outcomes may vary according to children's gender. Preschool children's transitions to school pose additional risks, as this developmental period is associated with increased social and cognitive demands. Despite the significance of this age group and the long-term implications associated with early internalizing symptoms, most studies have focused on early behavior problems; relatively few have examined early precursors of internalizing disorders. One potential risk factor, particularly during the preschool-to-school age transition, is emotion dysregulation. Specifically, emotion overregulation, or excessive control of emotions, is ill-defined in current literature but may be associated with later internalizing outcomes. Therefore, in the present study, operational definitions of emotion overregulation were examined and clarified. Structural equation modeling analyses were also conducted to investigate both concurrent and longitudinal relationships between overregulation, negative parenting, and internalizing outcome variables. The potential roles of social context and gender in relationships with children's adjustment were also explored. Participants were 235 children (113 girls) at elevated risk for behavior problems. Children's emotion dysregulation was assessed using a multi-method approach: (1) laboratory-based behavioral task; (2) mothers' reports of children's emotion overregulation-related temperament; and (3) teachers' reports of children's emotion dysregulated behavior. Negative parenting behaviors were assessed via maternal parenting questionnaires. Mothers and teachers reported on child internalizing outcomes at ages 3, 6, and 10 years. Our analysis revealed several interesting pathways between predictor variables and internalizing outcomes. In particular, several emotion overregulation variables predicted internalizing behaviors concurrently and longitudinally, and negative parenting predicted internalizing behaviors across time. Shy temperament, negative parenting, and internalizing behaviors were also stable from preschool to kindergarten, and prediction models also suggested temporal stability of these variables from preschool to late school-age. As expected, some differences between mother- and teacher-reported outcomes were found, suggesting the importance of examining multiple contexts. Although gender was not a significant moderator in the proposed model relationships, unique gender-related findings were revealed. Results are discussed with respect to the value of multi-contextual, multi-level analyses of children's early emotion regulation abilities and parenting behaviors for prevention of internalizing behavior problems.

Patient(s) A total of 116,430 female nurses, followed from 1993 to June 2011, as part of the Nurses' Health Study II cohort. Intervention(s) None. Main Outcome Measure(s) Self-reported, physician-diagnosed hypertension. Result(s) Compared with women who have never reported infertility, infertile women were at no greater risk of hypertension (multivariable adjusted relative risk (RR) = 1.01, with 95\% confidence interval [CI] [0.94-1.07]). Infertility due to tubal disease was associated with a higher risk of hypertension (RR = 1.15 [1.01-1.31]), but no other diagnoses were associated with hypertension risk, compared with women who did not report infertility (ovulatory disorder: RR = 1.03 [0.94-1.13]; cervical: RR = 0.88 [0.70-1.10]; male factor: RR = 1.05 [0.95-1.15]; other reason: RR = 1.02 [0.94-1.11]; reason not found: RR = 1.02 [0.95-1.10]). Infertile women collectively had 5,070 cases of hypertension. No clear pattern between use of fertility treatment and hypertension was found among infertile women (clomiphene citrate: RR = 0.97 [0.90-1.04]; gonadotropin alone: RR = 0.97 [0.87-1.08]; intrauterine insemination: RR = 0.86 [0.71-1.03]; in vitro fertilization: RR = 0.86 [0.73-1.01]). Conclusion(s) Among this relatively young cohort of women, no apparent increase occurred in hypertension risk among infertile women, or among women who had undergone fertility treatment previously.},

However, the invasive nature of surgery, coupled with the lack of a laboratory biomarker for the disease, results in a mean latency of 7\textendash 11 years from onset of symptoms to definitive diagnosis. Unfortunately, the delay in diagnosis may have significant consequences in terms of disease progression.

Older maternal age and the presence of comorbidities may affect cardiovascular (CV) women health. Safety aspects are central in risk assessment; we report the experience of internal medicine clinical setting at the ART center. Materials and Methods: we investigated 243 infertile women (110 autologous and 133 oocyte donation [OD]); cardiometabolic parameters and CV risk factors were investigated during the clinical evaluation. Results: We observed high prevalence of dyslipidemia (62.9\%), smoking habit (27.5\%), and body mass index (26.7\%). Waist {$\geq$}80 cm was present in 65\%, and waist to hip ratio (WHR) value {$>$}0.80 in 60.5\% of women. The prevalence of migraine with aura, hypertension, and diabetes was 5.3\%, 4.9\%, and 4.5\%, respectively. By evaluating variables according to autologous or OD ART, we observed that OD women were older than autologous, p {$<$} 0.0001. Overweight and obesity prevalence was higher in OD group; waist and WHR were significantly higher in autologous than in OD group (75\% vs. 57\%, p = 0.005, and 91.8\% vs. 34.6\%, p = 0.01, respectively). We observed a statistically significant unfavorable risk profile in OD in comparison to autologous women (p = 0.003); in particular, 60\% of OD women carried 3-5 CV risk factors, and 8.3\% carried at least six CV risk factors. Conclusions: The experience of an internal medicine clinic at the ART center strongly underlies the relevance of a careful medical evaluation before attempting ART, and suggests the opportuneness of a structured internal medicine clinic in every gynecology setting to better frame risk profile.},

Nonetheless, few well-designed efforts have been undertaken to promote positive and reduce negative youth outcomes by enhancing sibling relationships.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nMETHODS: Based on a theoretical model of sibling influences, we conducted a randomized trial of Siblings Are Special (SIBS), a group-format afterschool program for fifth graders with a younger sibling in second through fourth grades, which entailed 12 weekly afterschool sessions and three Family Nights. We tested program efficacy with a pre- and post-test design with 174 families randomly assigned to condition. In home visits at both time points, we collected data via parent questionnaires, child interviews, and observer-rated videotaped interactions and teachers rated children's behavior at school.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nRESULTS: The program enhanced positive sibling relationships, appropriate strategies for parenting siblings, and child self-control, social competence, and academic performance; program exposure was also associated with reduced maternal depression and child internalizing problems. Results were robust across the sample, not qualified by sibling gender, age, family demographics, or baseline risk. No effects were found for sibling conflict, collusion, or child externalizing problems; we will examine follow-up data to determine if short-term impacts lead to reduced negative behaviors over time.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSIONS: The breadth of the SIBS program's impact is consistent with research suggesting that siblings are an important influence on development and adjustment and supports our argument that a sibling focus should be incorporated into youth and family-oriented prevention programs.},

We identified 12 studies using the test-negative design (2011-2017) that reported VE estimates separately derived by 3 alternative control groups: 1) all patients testing negative for influenza (FLU), VE FLU-; 2) patients who tested positive for other/another respiratory virus (ORV), VE ORV+; and 3) patients who tested negative for all viruses in the panel (PAN), VE PAN-.

  abstract = {Purpose The goal of this study was to investigate the association between blood draws, injections, blood pressure readings, trauma, cellulitis in the at-risk arm, and air travel and increases in arm volume in a cohort of patients treated for breast cancer and screened for lymphedema. Patients and Methods Between 2005 and 2014, patients undergoing treatment of breast cancer at our institution were screened prospectively for lymphedema. Bilateral arm volume measurements were performed preoperatively and postoperatively using a Perometer. At each measurement, patients reported the number of blood draws, injections, blood pressure measurements, trauma to the at-risk arm(s), and number of flights taken since their last measurement. Arm volume was quantified using the relative volume change and weight-adjusted change formulas. Linear random effects models were used to assess the association between relative arm volume (as a continuous variable) and nontreatment risk factors, as well as clinical characteristics. Results In 3,041 measurements, there was no significant association between relative volume change or weight-adjusted change increase and undergoing one or more blood draws (P = .62), injections (P = .77), number of flights (one or two [P = .77] and three or more [P = .91] v none), or duration of flights (1 to 12 hours [P = .43] and 12 hours or more [P = .54] v none). By multivariate analysis, factors significantly associated with increases in arm volume included body mass index \$ 25 (P = .0236), axillary lymph node dissection (P , .001), regional lymph node irradiation (P = .0364), and cellulitis (P , .001). Conclusion This study suggests that although cellulitis increases risk of lymphedema, ipsilateral blood draws, injections, blood pressure readings, and air travel may not be associated with arm volume increases. The results may help to educate clinicians and patients on posttreatment risk, prevention, and management of lymphedema.},

  abstract = {It is widely believed that influenza (flu) vaccination of the elderly reduces all-cause mortality, yet randomized trials for assessing vaccine effectiveness are not feasible and the observational research has been controversial. Efforts to differentiate vaccine effectiveness from selection bias have been problematic. The authors examined mortality before, during, and after 9 flu seasons in relation to time-varying vaccination status in an elderly California population in which 115,823 deaths occurred from 1996 to 2005, including 20,484 deaths during laboratory-defined flu seasons. Vaccine coverage averaged 63\%; excess mortality when the flu virus was circulating averaged 7.8\%. In analyses that omitted weeks when flu circulated, the odds ratio measuring the vaccination-mortality association increased monotonically from 0.34 early in November to 0.56 in January, 0.67 in April, and 0.76 in August. This reflects the trajectory of selection effects in the absence of flu. In analyses that included weeks with flu and adjustment for selection effects, flu season multiplied the odds ratio by 0.954. The corresponding vaccine effectiveness estimate was 4.6\% (95\% confidence interval: 0.7, 8.3). To differentiate vaccine effects from selection bias, the authors used logistic regression with a novel case-centered specification that may be useful in other population-based studies when the exposure-outcome association varies markedly over time.},

By focusing on estimating a specific target of interest (e.g., the average effect of a treatment), rather than on estimating the full underlying data generating distribution, IF-based estimators are often able to achieve asymptotically optimal mean-squared error. Still, many researchers find IF-based estimators to be opaque or overly technical, which makes their use less prevalent and their benefits less available. To help foster understanding and trust in IF-based estimators, we present tangible, visual illustrations of when and how IF-based estimators can outperform standard ``plugin''estimators.

This design has not been validated for the inpatient setting where selection bias might be different from an outpatient setting. METHODS We derived mathematical expressions for vaccine effectiveness (VE) against laboratory-confirmed influenza hospitalizations and used numerical simulations to verify theoretical results exploring expected biases under various scenarios. We explored meaningful interpretations of VE estimates from inpatient TND studies. RESULTS VE estimates from inpatient TND studies capture the vaccine-mediated protection of the source population against laboratory-confirmed influenza hospitalizations. If vaccination does not modify disease severity, these estimates are equivalent to VE against influenza virus infection. If chronic cardiopulmonary individuals are enrolled because of non-infectious exacerbation, biased VE estimates (too high) will result. If chronic cardiopulmonary disease status is adjusted for accurately, the VE estimates will be unbiased. If chronic cardiopulmonary illness cannot be adequately be characterized, excluding these individuals may provide unbiased VE estimates. CONCLUSIONS The inpatient TND offers logistic advantages and can provide valid estimates of influenza VE. If highly vaccinated patients with respiratory exacerbation of chronic cardiopulmonary conditions are eligible for study inclusion, biased VE estimates will result unless this group is well characterized and the analysis can adequately adjust for it. Otherwise, such groups of subjects should be excluded from the analysis.},

Because the Program has nearly universal access to prenatal diagnostic information and to follow-up data on elective terminations, Hawaii is an ideal setting in which to study their effects on prevalence rates of birth defects. Except for oral clefts, a large proportion of the defects studied were prenatally diagnosed: anencephaly (87\%), spina bifida (62\%), encephalocele (83\%), cleft palate (0\%), cleft lip with or without cleft palate (14\%), omphalocele (60\%), gastroschisis (76\%), Down syndrome (43\%), trisomy 18 (61 \%), and trisomy 13 (40\%). The effect of elective terminations on the birth prevalence rates for most of these birth defects was significant. Including electively terminated cases in the calculations of birth prevalence rates increased the rates by more than 50\% for five of the 10 birth defects studied.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a preventable birth defect, easiest to recognize in children two through eleven years and more difficult to recognize in newborns. In New York State, two systems ascertain FAS cases, the statewide birth defects registry and the Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Surveillance Network (FASSNet) system. The accuracy of FAS reports to the birth defects registry was assessed through a comparison with the FASSNet system.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nMETHODS: The birth defects registry mandates reporting up to age two, including FAS with an ICD-9 code of 760.71. FASSNet is a population-based, multi-source surveillance and uses a standard definition to determine FAS case status.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nRESULTS: Among 33 children reported to the registry with FAS, 19 (58\%) met FASSNet criteria for FAS. FASSNet identified 24 additional children with FAS facial features documented before the child's second birthday that should have been reported to the birth defects registry. FAS prevalence rate for the birth defects registry was 0.28 per 1,000 live births but would have been 0.37 if all children diagnosed before age two were included.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSIONS: Almost 60\% of children reported to a birth defects registry with FAS from 1995 to 1998 were confirmed as FAS based on a more intensive surveillance. Additional children with FAS were not reported to the CMR. FAS prevalence calculated from birth defects registries, relying on the ICD-9 code 760.71, include false positives and underestimate the true prevalence. Age limits for reporting FAS to registries further contribute to under ascertainment.},

Methods: The authors present a method for probabilistic sensitivity analysis to quantify likely effects of misclassification of a dichotomous outcome, exposure or covariate. This method involves reconstructing the data that would have been observed had the misclassified variable been correctly classified, given the sensitivity and specificity of classification. The accompanying SAS macro implements the method and allows users to specify ranges of sensitivity and specificity of misclassification parameters to yield simulation intervals that incorporate both systematic and random error. Results: The authors illustrate the method and the accompanying SAS macro code by applying it to a study of the relation between occupational resin exposure and lung-cancer deaths. The authors compare the results using this method with the conventional result, which accounts for random error only, and with the original sensitivity analysis results Conclusion: By accounting for plausible degrees of misclassification, investigators can present study results in a way that incorporates uncertainty about the bias due to misclassification, and so avoid misleadingly precise-looking results. \textcopyright{} The Author 2005; all rights reserved.},

Reviewers thereby act as critical gatekeepers to high-quality research. They are asked to carefully consider the validity of the proposed work or research findings by paying careful attention to the methodology and critiquing the importance of the insight gained. However, although many have noted problems with the peer-review system for both manuscripts and grant submissions, few solutions have been proposed to improve the process. Quantitative bias analysis encompasses all methods used to quantify the impact of systematic error on estimates of effect in epidemiologic research. Reviewers who insist that quantitative bias analysis be incorporated into the design, conduct, presentation, and interpretation of epidemiologic research could substantially strengthen the process. In the present commentary, we demonstrate how quantitative bias analysis can be used by investigators and authors, reviewers, funding agencies, and editors. By utilizing quantitative bias analysis in the peer-review process, editors can potentially avoid unnecessary rejections, identify key areas for improvement, and improve discussion sections by shifting from speculation on the impact of sources of error to quantification of the impact those sources of bias may have had.},

We less often consider cost-efficiencies in terms of dealing with systematic errors that arise within a study, such as in deciding how to measure study variables and misclassification implications. Methods: Given the information used to inform a study size calculation, the expected study data can be simulated during study planning, and the impact of anticipated biases can be estimated using quantitative bias analysis. This would allow investigators and stakeholders to identify areas where better data collection through more valid instruments is critical and where additional investment will not yield strong validity benefits. This could promote better use of study resources and help increase investigators' chances of funding by demonstrating they have thought through biases and have a plan for mitigating the impact. Results: We demonstrate how this would work with a practical example using the relationship between smoking during pregnancy as measured on birth certificates and incident breast cancer. Conclusions: We show that although exposure sensitivity would likely be poor, spending more money to get a better smoking measure is unlikely to yield more valid estimates.},

  abstract = {We consider studies of cohorts of individuals after a critical event, such as an injury, with the following characteristics. First, the studies are designed to measure "input" variables, which describe the period before the critical event, and to characterize the distribution of the input variables in the cohort. Second, the studies are designed to measure "output" variables, primarily mortality after the critical event, and to characterize the predictive (conditional) distribution of mortality given the input variables in the cohort. Such studies often possess the complication that the input data are missing for those who die shortly after the critical event because the data collection takes place after the event. Standard methods of dealing with the missing inputs, such as imputation or weighting methods based on an assumption of ignorable missingness, are known to be generally invalid when the missingness of inputs is nonignorable, that is, when the distribution of the inputs is different between those who die and those who live. To address this issue, we propose a novel design that obtains and uses information on an additional key variable-a treatment or externally controlled variable, which if set at its "effective" level, could have prevented the death of those who died. We show that the new design can be used to draw valid inferences for the marginal distribution of inputs in the entire cohort, and for the conditional distribution of mortality given the inputs, also in the entire cohort, even under nonignorable missingness. The crucial framework that we use is principal stratification based on the potential outcomes, here mortality under both levels of treatment. We also show using illustrative preliminary injury data that our approach can reveal results that are more reasonable than the results of standard methods, in relatively dramatic ways. Thus, our approach suggests that the routine collection of data on variables that could be used as possible treatments in such studies of inputs and mortality should become common.},

One may control for the alternate cause through an experiment (e.g., with random assignment to treatment and control) or by measuring a corresponding confounding variable and including it in the model. Unfortunately, there are some circumstances under which it is not possible to measure or control for the potentially confounding variable. Under these circumstances, it is helpful to assess the robustness of a statistical inference to the inclusion of a potentially confounding variable. In this article, an index is derived for quantifying the impact of a confounding variable on the inference of a regression coefficient. The index is developedfor the bivariate case and then generalized to the multivariate case, and the distribution of the index is discussed. The index also is compared with existing indexes and procedures. An example is presented for the relationship between socioeconomic background and educational attainment, and a reference distribution for the index is obtained. The potential for the index to inform causal inferences is discussed, as are extensions.},

Greater reliance on such real world data (RWD) in regulatory decision making requires understanding why some studies fail while others succeed in producing results similar to RCTs. Key questions when considering whether RWD analyses can substitute for RCTs for regulatory decision making are WHEN one can study drug effects without randomization and HOW to implement a valid RWD analysis if one has decided to pursue that option. The WHEN is primarily driven by externalities not controlled by investigators, whereas the HOW is focused on avoiding known mistakes in RWD analyses.},

Offspring of mothers with existing diabetes had a threefold risk of achieving no GCSEs graded A*-C, whilst offspring of women with gestational diabetes had, on average, a five point lower IQ compared to offspring of women with no diabetes or glycosuria.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSIONS: Maternal diabetes in pregnancy is consistently associated with lower offspring cognition and educational attainment though confidence intervals were wide.

METHODS: We linked national registers and conducted a prospective cohort study of singleton Swedish-born men to explore associations between maternal pregnancy diabetes and educational achievement at age 16 years, the age of completing compulsory education in Sweden (n = 391,545 men from 337,174 families, graduating in 1988-1997 and n = 326,033 men from 282,079 families, graduating in 1998-2009), and intelligence quotient (IQ) at the mandatory conscription examination at 18 years of age (n = 664,871 from 543,203 families). RESULTS: Among non-siblings, maternal diabetes in pregnancy was associated with lower offspring cognitive ability even after adjustment for maternal age at birth, parity, education, early-pregnancy BMI, offspring birth year, gestational age and birthweight. For example, in non-siblings, the IQ of men whose mothers had diabetes in their pregnancy was on average 1.36 points lower (95\% CI -2.12, -0.60) than men whose mothers did not have diabetes. In comparison, we found no such association within sibships (mean difference 1.70; 95\% CI -1.80, 5.21). CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The association between maternal diabetes in pregnancy and offspring cognitive outcomes is likely explained by shared familial characteristics and not by an intrauterine mechanism.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Among patients with biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy, we found previously that postoperative prostate-specific antigen doubling time (PSADT) was associated with risk of prostate cancer death. However, given the small number of patients in the highest risk PSADT subgroup, it is unclear which PSADT subgroups contribute the greatest to prostate cancer-specific death and how this influences all-cause mortality. Patients and Methods: This study was a retrospective analysis of 379 patients treated with radical prostatectomy between 1982 and 2000 who had a biochemical recurrence and PSADT data available. Mean and median follow-up after surgery was 11.4 (standard deviation, 5.4) and 11.0 years, respectively (range, 1.6 to 23.0 years). Results: Shorter PSADT was significantly associated with prostate cancer-specific and all-cause mortality (P {$<$} .001). Although patients with a PSADT less than 3 months were at the greatest risk of death, because of the limited number of patients in this group, they accounted for only 13\% of prostate cancer deaths at 15 years after biochemical recurrence, whereas patients with an intermediate PSADT (3.0 to 8.9 months) accounted for 58\% of all prostate cancer deaths. Among patients with a PSADT less than 15 months, prostate cancer accounted for 90\% of all deaths. Only patients in the slowest PSADT subgroup ({$\geq$} 15 months) had a greater risk of competing-causes mortality compared with that from prostate cancer. Conclusion: Among a select cohort of young, healthy patients with PSA recurrence after radical prostatectomy and a PSADT less than 15 months, prostate cancer accounted for an estimated 90\% of all deaths by 15 years after recurrence. The majority of prostate cancer deaths occurred among patients with an intermediate PSADT (3.0 to 8.9 months). \textcopyright{} 2007 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.},

For example, to examine whether serum cholesterol level is an intermediate endpoint for coronary heart disease (CHD), we may investigate the effect of the cholesterol lowering drug cholestyramine on CHD incidence adjusted for serum cholesterol levels. We show that use of this criterion will usually demand some form of model selection. When the unadjusted exposure or treatment effect is less than four times its standard error, the analysis can usually lead only to a weak form of validation, a conclusion that the data are not inconsistent with the validation criterion. More significant unadjusted exposure effects offer the potential for stronger types of validation statement such as 'the intermediate endpoint explains at least 50 per cent (or 75 per cent) of the exposure effect'.},

  abstract = {Most improvements in health achieved since the early 20th century can be reasonably attributed to the advance-ment and application of knowledge. The latter occurs through three main mechanisms: its transformation into health technologies, such as drugs, vaccines, and diagnostic procedures; its internalization by individuals, who use it to guide their everyday life in crucial domains for health, such as personal hygiene, nutrition, and sexual behavior, among others; and finally, its translation into evidence that pro-vides a scientific foundation both for health care and for policy formulation, implementation, and evaluation [1]. There are three basic reasons why knowledge should increasingly support policy design, implementation, and evaluation. First, we are living in a time of unparalleled and accelerated transformation. Low-and middle-income countries, in particular, are witnessing a complex epidemi-ological transition characterized by a triple burden of dis-ease: the unfinished agenda of common infections, undernutrition, and maternal mortality; the emerging chal-lenges of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), mental prob-lems, and injury; and the health risks directly related to globalization, such as climate change and pandemics [2]. The use of evidence in the documentation and discussion of the determinants, nature, magnitude, and distribution of health challenges is critical. Second, the search for universal health coverage (UHC), which is becoming a core component of the post-2015 development agenda, demands major innovations. The still vast set of unanswered questions about health system per-formance demands the inclusion of a research agenda in every policy initiative. The third reason is accountability. Due to the increasing awareness about the contribution of health to global secu-rity, economic growth, and democratic governance, devel-opment assistance for health grew from US\$10 billion in 2000 to over US\$28 billion in 2012 [3]. However, to secure the sustainability of these unprecedented financial efforts, we need to guarantee, in the words of the late Professor Ramalingaswami of India, not only more money for health but also more health for the money. In sum, the world as a whole requires a new generation of innovations, not just in conventional technologies, but also in the way we organize and finance health systems. In this search, knowledge must be the driving force. Two social policy innovations implemented in Mexico illustrate the uses of evidence to improve nutrition status, health conditions, and financial protection in health. The first example is Oportunidades (or Opportunities in En-glish), a ''conditional cash transfer'' (CCT) program intro-duced in the late-1990s to enhance basic capabilities of families living in extreme poverty. This program offers in-come supplements to poor families willing to fulfill certain elements of coresponsibility. To receive the cash transfer, Oportunidades families were originally required to send children to school rather than work; attend a health clinic to receive a package of health promotion and disease pre-vention interventions, including vaccines; and provide a nutritional supplement to pregnant and lactating women, all children aged 6e23 months and low-weight children aged 2e5 years [4]. In a decision that proved to be far sighted, the team in charge of Oportunidades, headed by a visionary demogra-pher, the late Jos e G omez de Le on, decided to evaluate its impact using a controlled randomized design [5]. In Conflict of interest: I, Till B\texteuro{} arnighausen, declare that I have no conflict of interest regarding this manuscript (Frenk, Octavio G omez-Dant es; ''Systematic Generation of Evidence through Public Policy Evaluation''), which I am submitting as one of the guest editors of the themed issue of the Journal of Clinical Epidemiology on ''Quasi-experimental study designs in health systems research and synthesis''.},

The results suggested that, strictly in terms of behavioral covariation, conduct problems in children may best be conceptualized in terms of two orthogonal dimensions of behavior: (1) an overt/covert dimension and (2) a destructive/nondestructive dimension. The four quadrants created by the intersection of these two bipolar dimensions corresponded well to distinctions among norm-violating behaviors made by legal systems and previous diagnostic conceptualizations: oppositional, aggressive, property violations, and status offenses. The results of this meta-analysis were cross-validated in a clinic sample of 177 boys age 7\textendash 12. One major finding from the validation sample was a strong correspondence between empirically derived syndromes based on the meta-analysis and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (3rd ed. rev., American Psychiatric Association, 1987) (DSM-III-R) definitions of conduct disorder and oppositional defiant disorder. A second major finding from the validation study was that age of onset may be a critical variable in explaining the results of the meta-analysis.},

Thus, the objective of the present study was to assess the effects of maternal HIV infection, nutritional status and obstetric history, and season of birth on gestation length and birth size. The study population was 1669 antenatal care attendees in Harare, Zimbabwe. A prospective cohort study was conducted as part of a randomised, controlled trial. Maternal anthropometry, age, gravidity, and HIV status and load were assessed in 22nd-35th weeks gestation. Outcomes were gestation length and birth size. Birth data were available from 1106 (66.3\%) women, of which 360 (32.5\%) had HIV infection. Mean gestation length was 39.1 weeks with 16.6\% {$<$}37 weeks, mean birth weight was 3030 g with 10.5\% {$<$}2500 g. Gestation length increased with age in primigravidae, but not multigravidae (interaction, P=0.005), and birth in the early dry season, low arm fat area, multiple pregnancies and maternal HIV load were negative predictors. Birth weight increased with maternal height, and birth in the late rainy and early dry season; primi-secundigravidity, low arm fat area, HIV load, multiple pregnancies and female sex were negative predictors. In conclusion, gestation length and birth weight decline with increasing maternal HIV load. In addition, season of birth, gravidity, maternal height and body fat mass, and infant sex are predictors of birth weight.},

Approximately 9.2 million individuals aged 40-69 years who lived within 25 miles (40 km) of one of 22 assessment centers in England, Wales, and Scotland were invited to enter the cohort, and 5.5\% participated in the baseline assessment. The representativeness of the UK Biobank cohort was investigated by comparing demographic characteristics between nonresponders and responders. Sociodemographic, physical, lifestyle, and health-related characteristics of the cohort were compared with nationally representative data sources. UK Biobank participants were more likely to be older, to be female, and to live in less socioeconomically deprived areas than nonparticipants. Compared with the general population, participants were less likely to be obese, to smoke, and to drink alcohol on a daily basis and had fewer self-reported health conditions. At age 70-74 years, rates of all-cause mortality and total cancer incidence were 46.2\% and 11.8\% lower, respectively, in men and 55.5\% and 18.1\% lower, respectively, in women than in the general population of the same age. UK Biobank is not representative of the sampling population; there is evidence of a "healthy volunteer" selection bias. Nonetheless, valid assessment of exposure-disease relationships may be widely generalizable and does not require participants to be representative of the population at large.},

The goal of the paper is to introduce a new form of indirect effect, the population intervention indirect effect, that can be non-parametrically identified in the presence of an unmeasured common cause of exposure and outcome. This new type of indirect effect captures the extent to which the effect of exposure is mediated by an intermediate variable under an intervention that holds the component of exposure directly influencing the outcome at its observed value. The population intervention indirect effect is in fact the indirect component of the population intervention effect, introduced by Hubbard and Van der Laan. Interestingly, our identification criterion generalizes Judea Pearl's front door criterion as it does not require no direct effect of exposure not mediated by the intermediate variable. For inference, we develop both parametric and semiparametric methods, including a novel doubly robust semiparametric locally efficient estimator, that perform very well in simulation studies. Finally, the methods proposed are used to measure the effectiveness of monetary saving recommendations among women enrolled in a maternal health programme in Tanzania.},

We have used this to compare the seasonal pattern of intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR, as reflected by weight-for-gestational-age) and preterm delivery (as assessed by Dubowitz scoring) among 1718 infants born in rural Gambia. Both outcomes were analysed as binary variables: small-for-gestational-age (SGA, {$<$}10th centile of reference standard) and preterm ({$<$}37 weeks) respectively. Percentages of preterm and SGA babies show divergent seasonal patterns that might indicate separate aetiologies. However, seasonal effects influencing intrauterine growth are likely to be cumulative over the last few months of pregnancy. By modelling seasonality with truncated Fourier series we were able to deconvolve the underlying seasonal influences on fetal growth from the pattern for SGA. This enabled us to use seemingly unrelated biprobit regression to compare the underlying seasonal pattern of intrauterine growth with that governing the incidence of preterm delivery. We conclude that, if the seasonal factors affecting intrauterine growth operate over more than the last 2 months of pregnancy, then the seasonal patterns of the factors causing IUGR and preterm delivery are indistinguishable if the factors are assumed to trigger preterm delivery immediately, but differ if preterm delivery is assumed to be programmed by factors acting at conception.},

GWG in early pregnancy (defined as 0-18 weeks on the basis of a knot point at 18 weeks) and midpregnancy (defined as 18-28 weeks on the basis of knot points at 18 and 28 weeks) was positively associated with School Entry Assessment score and intelligence quotient. GWG in late pregnancy (defined as 28 weeks onward on the basis of a knot point at 28 weeks) was positively associated with offspring intelligence quotient and with increased odds of offspring achieving adequate final-examination results in mothers who were overweight prepregnancy.

Yet, there is little evidence for the counterpart that profuse resources during early development may prove detrimental in an impoverished adult environment. Using birth season as a proxy for nutrition in utero, this study tests whether early life effects on longevity are conditional on the environment in which people reside during adulthood. METHODS: I used Cox proportional hazard models of mortality after the age of 60 years among historical cohorts of French Canadian women born before 1750. Models are stratified by siblings to adjust the results for unobserved factors shared by family members. RESULTS: A birth during winter conferred the best-survival prospects in the south of the Saint-Lawrence River but the worse prospects in the north, where a birth during the fall was associated with the lowest mortality. Women who migrated to live on the other side of the river lost whatever advantage or disadvantage they had from their birth season and faced increases or decreases in risk that were specific to their new location. CONCLUSIONS: Based on Hales and Barker's thrifty phenotype hypothesis, and adding the "hopeful phenotype" counterpart, this study suggests that cues from the external environment during development are highly specific to that environment and that the slightest change of location may affect the chances for survival into old age. I finally address the role of fertility as a possible mediator or modifier of the effect of birth season on longevity.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To comprehensively review and evaluate the direct costs of endometriosis. DESIGN AND SETTING: We systematically reviewed studies published since 1990, and conducted an analysis of publicly available national databases (Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project and National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey/National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey) in the United States. We assessed: [1] the overall economic impact of endometriosis; [2] the direct costs associated with specific treatments; and [3] the indirect costs of endometriosis associated with reduced work productivity. RESULTS: Of 13 published studies meeting inclusion criteria, 11 (85\%) addressed direct costs, a few studies addressed outpatient costs or indirect costs, and no study quantified the economic impact among adolescents. Direct endometriosis-related costs were considerable and appeared driven by hospitalizations. Our database analysis found: [1] as endometriosis-related hospital length of stay steadily declined from 1993 to 2002, per-patient cost increased 61\%; [2] adolescents (aged 10-17 years) had endometriosis-related hospitalizations; [3] approximately 50\% of {$>$}600,000 endometriosis-related ambulatory patient visits involved specialist care; and [4] females 23 years old or younger constituted {$>$}20\% of endometriosis-related outpatient visits. CONCLUSIONS: Health economic information for endometriosis is scarce, limiting our understanding of its overall economic impact. Nevertheless, the literature and other available data suggest that endometriosis places a considerable burden on patients and society.},

A frequent goal of these observational analyses is to use the data to emulate a hypothetical randomized experiment, i.e., the target trial, that mimics the design features of a true experiment, including a clear definition of time zero with synchronization of treatment assignment and determination of eligibility. We review a recent observational analysis that explicitly emulated a target trial of screening colonoscopy using insurance claims from U.S. Medicare. We then compare this explicit emulation with alternative, simpler observational analyses that do not synchronize treatment assignment and eligibility determination at time zero and/or do not allow for repeated eligibility. This empirical comparison suggests that lack of an explicit emulation of the target trial leads to biased estimates, and shows that allowing for repeated eligibility increases the statistical efficiency of the estimates.},

  abstract = {Background The optimal timing to start androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in prostate cancer patients with rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA) as the only sign of relapse is unknown. Methods We identified men with prostate cancer in the Cancer of the Prostate Strategic Urologic Research Endeavour (CaPSURE) study who would have been eligible ({$\leq$} cT3aN0M0, primary radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy, PSA relapse as the only evidence of recurrence) for a randomised trial comparing 'immediate' versus 'deferred' ADT initiation. We emulated such trial by assigning patients to the 'immediate' strategy if they initiated ADT within 3 months of PSA relapse and to the 'deferred' strategy if they initiated ADT when they presented with metastasis, symptoms or a short PSA doubling time. We censored patients when they deviated from the assigned strategy and adjusted for this censoring via inverse probability weighting. Results Of 2096 eligible patients (median age 69, interquartile range 63-75 years), 88\% were white, 35\% had a Gleason score {$\geq$}7, 69\% were treated with radical prostatectomy and 31\% received radiotherapy only as primary treatment. The mean time from primary treatment to PSA relapse was 37.4 (standard deviation [SD] 34.2) months. Mean follow-up from primary treatment was 91.4 (SD 48.4) months. The adjusted mortality hazard ratio for immediate versus deferred ADT was 0.91 (95\% confidence interval (CI), 0.52-1.60), which would be translated into a similar 5-year survival (difference between groups: -2.0\% (95\% CI: -10.0 to 5.9\%). Conclusion Our analysis suggests that prostate cancer patients undergoing immediate ADT initiation within three months after PSA-only relapse had similar survival to those who deferred ADT initiation within 3 months after clinical progression.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Diesel exhaust has been considered to be a probable lung carcinogen based on studies of occupationally exposed workers. Efforts to define lung cancer risk in these studies have been limited in part by lack of quantitative exposure estimates. OBJECTIVE: We conducted a retrospective cohort study to assess lung cancer mortality risk among U.S. trucking industry workers. Elemental carbon (EC) was used as a surrogate of exposure to engine exhaust from diesel vehicles, traffic, and loading dock operations. METHODS: Work records were available for 31,135 male workers employed in the unionized U.S. trucking industry in 1985. A statistical model based on a national exposure assessment was used to estimate historical work-related exposures to EC. Lung cancer mortality was ascertained through the year 2000, and associations with cumulative and average EC were estimated using proportional hazards models. RESULTS: Duration of employment was inversely associated with lung cancer risk consistent with a healthy worker survivor effect and a cohort composed of prevalent hires. After adjusting for employment duration, we noted a suggestion of a linear exposure response relationship. For each I,000-mu g/m(3) months of cumulative EC, based on a 5-year exposure lag, the hazard ratio (HR) was 1.07 [95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.99, 1.15] with a similar association for a 10-year exposure lag [HR = 1.09 (95\% CI: 0.99, 1.20)]. Average exposure was not associated with relative risk. CONCLUSIONS: Lung cancer mortality in trucking industry workers increased in association with cumulative exposure to EC after adjusting for negative confounding by employment duration.},

They are the method proposed by Cornfield, the logit method with 1/2 corrections first considered by Woolf, and the test-based method proposed by Miettinen. Cornfield's method comes closest to attaining the nominal confidence coefficient. The logit method typically has actual confidence coefficients somewhat too lartge with disparate tail areas. The latter is ascribed in part to the enhanced skewness induced by the logit transformation itself. The test-based method has actual coefficients uniformly less than nominal when R not= 1. This underestimation is worse in finite samples than Halperin found it to be asymptotically. Although the Cornfield and test-based methods have the same confidence coefficients for R = 1, the test-based method is more likely to cover distant values of R not= 1 when in fact R =1. It is concluded that Cornfields's method without the continuity correction is the preferred approximate method in the unconditional space as, with the continuity correction, it was previously found to be in the conditional space.},

The Taiwan National Health Institute Research Database was searched for women who had taken hormonal contraceptives or infertility medications from 2000 to 2010. The two groups were age and index date matched with controls (1:4 ratios). Cox regression analysis was used to examine the risks of VTE, DTE, PE, ischemic stroke, and cardiovascular disease.

After adjustment for age, comorbidities, and other confounders, the contraceptives group had a higher risk of VTE (adjusted HR 1.14, 95\% CI 1.004 to 1.30) and cardiovascular disease (adjusted HR 1.30, 95\% CI 1.26 to 1.34), and lower risk of ischemic stroke (adjusted HR 0.90, 95\% CI 0.86 to 0.95).

Such models can overfit, leading to causal inferences that are substantively implausible and that arbitrarily attribute variation to the high-degree polynomial or the discontinuity. This paper examines two recent studies that make use of regression discontinuity to discuss evident practical problems with these estimates and how they interact with pathologies of the current system of scientific publication. First, we discuss a recent study that estimates the effect on air pollution and life expectancy of a coal-heating policy in China. The reported effects, based on a third-degree polynomial, are statistically significant but substantively dubious, and are sensitive to model choice. This study is indicative of a category of policy analyses where strong claims are based on weak data and methodologies which permit the researcher wide latitude in presenting estimated treatment effects. We then replicate a procedure from Green et al., in which regression discontinuity is used to recover estimated treatment effects relative to an experimental benchmark, to illustrate one practical problem with the regression discontinuity estimates in the coal-heating paper: high-degree polynomials yield noisy estimates of treatment effects that do not accurately convey uncertainty. We recommend that (a) researchers consider the problems which may result from controlling for higher-order polynomials; and (b) that journals recognize that quantitative analyses of policy issues are often inconclusive and relax the implicit rule under which statistical significance is a condition for publication.},

Strategies for managing the impact of loss to follow-up are therefore needed to maximize the value of studies conducted in these cohorts. The authors evaluated adult patients starting antiretroviral therapy at an HIV/AIDS clinic in Uganda, where 29\% of patients were lost to follow-up after 2 years (January 1, 2004-September 30, 2007). Unweighted, inverse probability of censoring weighted (IPCW), and sampling-based approaches (using supplemental data from a sample of lost patients subsequently tracked in the community) were used to identify the predictive value of sex on mortality. Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) were used to explore the structural basis for bias in each approach. Among 3,628 patients, unweighted and IPCW analyses found men to have higher mortality than women, whereas the sampling-based approach did not. DAGs encoding knowledge about the data-generating process, including the fact that death is a cause of being classified as lost to follow-up in this setting, revealed "collider" bias in the unweighted and IPCW approaches. In a clinic-based cohort in Africa, unweighted and IPCW approaches-which rely on the "missing at random" assumption-yielded biased estimates. A sampling-based approach can in general strengthen epidemiologic analyses conducted in many clinic-based cohorts, including those examining other diseases.

This effect is not moderated by sex, prior aggressiveness, or parental monitoring and is only slightly moderated by age, as younger children had a larger increase in initial aggressive cognition related to initial violent game play at the beginning of the study than older children. Model fit was excellent for all models.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Given that more than 90\% of youths play video games, understanding the psychological mechanisms by which they can influence behaviors is important for parents and pediatricians and for designing interventions to enhance or mitigate the effects.},

Animal models demonstrate that early iron deficiency affects neuronal and glial energy metabolism, monoamine metabolism and myelination, consistent with behavioural findings in human infants. Of particular recent interest are genomic changes in transcripts coding for signal transduction, dendritic structure and energy metabolism induced by early iron deficiency that last well into adulthood in spite of iron treatment.

It is imperative that new and novel approaches be used to measure maternal mortality and to better understand existing data. In this paper we present one approach: an epidemiologic framework for identifying the identification and quantification of systematic error (multiple-bias analysis), outline the necessary steps for investigators interested in conducting multiple-bias analyses in their own data, and suggest approaches for reporting such analyses in the literature. Methods: To conceptualize the systematic error present in studies of abortion-related deaths, we propose a bias framework. We posit that selection bias and misclassification are present in both verbal autopsy studies and facility-based studies. The multiple-bias analysis framework provides a relatively simple, quantitative strategy for assessing systematic error and resulting bias in any epidemiologic study. Results: In our worked example of multiple-bias analysis on a study reporting 20.6 \% of maternal deaths to be abortion related, after adjustment for selection bias, misclassification, and random error, the median increased, on average, to 0.308, approximately 20 \% greater than the reported proportion of abortion-related deaths. Conclusions: Reporting results of multiple-bias analyses in estimates of abortion-related mortality, predictors of unsafe abortion, and other reproductive health questions that suffer from similar biases would not only improve reporting practices in the field, but might also provide a more accurate understanding of the range of potential impact of policies and programs that target the underlying causes of unsafe abortion and abortion-related mortality.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND The micronutrient depletion hypothesis proposes that consecutive pregnancies spaced too closely may leave insufficient time for maternal micronutrient replenishment. Short interpregnancy intervals (IPI) have been associated with an increased risk for several adverse pregnancy outcomes, but an association with gastroschisis risk has not been previously explored. METHODS Within a population-based, case-control study, we evaluated the association between IPI length and gastroschisis risk using multivariable logistic regression models to estimate gastroschisis odds ratios for IPI {$<$}12 months and 12 to 17 months relative to those 18 to 23 months. We further evaluated the association between IPI and gastroschisis risk stratified by maternal age, periconceptional multivitamin use, preceding pregnancy outcome, study center region, and season of conception to explore whether observed associations were compatible with the hypothesis of maternal micronutrient depletion. RESULTS For women with IPI {$<$}12 months, the adjusted odds ratio (aOR) was 1.7 (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 1.1\textendash 2.5). The magnitude of the observed effect did not differ among strata of maternal age or periconceptional multivitamin use. However, the association was more pronounced after a miscarriage or termination (aOR: 2.5; 95\% CI: 1.1\textendash 5.6) and among women who resided in northern study areas (aOR: 2.8; 95\% CI: 1.3\textendash 5.9). The higher risk observed with short IPI among women in northern study areas was attenuated for spring/summer conceptions. CONCLUSION Short IPI was associated with an increased risk for gastroschisis, particularly among women whose preceding pregnancy resulted in a miscarriage or termination and among those who resided in northern study areas with winter/fall conception.

A Bayesian analysis incorporating prior knowledge about the relationships between antihistamines, birth defects, and measured covariates was conducted.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nRESULTS: Of the 364 associations investigated, 24 had 95\% posterior intervals excluding 1.0. All 24 associations were positive; 23 associations were of weak to moderate magnitude (posterior OR {$<$} 3.0) and one was strong (OR {$>$} 6.0) but very imprecise. Of the 24 associations, 20 were with noncardiac defects. Eight associations involved the antihistamine diphenhydramine.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSIONS: The results of this study generally were consistent with no association between birth defects and antihistamine use during early pregnancy.

Current practice and research evidence were summarized. Results Four thousand nine hundred twenty-four records were retrieved by database searches, and additional documents were obtained by other searches. QE studies are challenging to identify efficiently because they have no standardized nomenclature and may be indexed in various ways. Reliable search filters are not available. There is a lack of specific resources devoted to collecting QE studies and little evidence on where best to search. Conclusion Searches to identify QE studies should search a range of resources and, until indexing improves, use strategies that focus on the topic rather than the study design. Better definitions, better indexing in databases, prospective registers, and reporting guidance are required to improve the retrieval of QE studies and promote systematic reviews of what works based on the evidence from such studies.},

  abstract = {Objective: To explore associations between infertility and metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular events. Infertility is increasingly a public health issue, with emerging links to chronic disease. Existing literature on infertility focuses primarily on known causes, which likely excludes a substantial number of women for whom there is no known cause or formal diagnosis. Design/Setting: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis examining the association between self-reported infertility (i.e., ever experiencing inability to conceive after 12 months of trying to become pregnant) and metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular events (i.e., congestive heart failure, coronary heart disease, heart attack, or stroke). Data were analyzed using multivariate logistic regression. Patient(s): A total of 744 U.S. women, 20\textendash 59 years of age, from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2013\textendash 2014), participated in the study. Among them, 15.7\% reported ever experiencing infertility, 27.6\% met the definition of metabolic syndrome, and 2.84\% reported ever having a cardiovascular event. Intervention(s): N/A. Main Outcome Measure(s): Metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular events. Results: Compared to women who had never experienced infertility, women who reported infertility had a 1.79 (95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.04, 3.08) higher odds of reporting symptoms of metabolic syndrome and 1.83 (95\% CI 1.15, 2.89) times higher odds of having experienced a cardiovascular event. Furthermore, women with self-reported infertility had a 71\% higher odds of reporting a cardiovascular event after controlling for metabolic syndrome (95\% CI 1.01, 3.00). Conclusions: Our results suggest that among U.S. women, the experience of infertility at any point in a woman's reproductive window may be associated with later-life cardiovascular health.},

These assumptions are not routinely systematically evaluated in MR applications, although such evaluation could add to the credibility of MR analyses. In this article, the authors present several methods that are useful for evaluating the validity of an MR study. They apply these methods to a recent MR study that used fat mass and obesity-associated (FTO) genotype as an IV to estimate the effect of obesity on mental disorder. These approaches to evaluating assumptions for valid IV analyses are not fail-safe, in that there are situations where the approaches might either fail to identify a biased IV or inappropriately suggest that a valid IV is biased. Therefore, the authors describe the assumptions upon which the IV assessments rely. The methods they describe are relevant to any IV analysis, regardless of whether it is based on a genetic IV or other possible sources of exogenous variation. Methods that assess the IV assumptions are generally not conclusive, but routinely applying such methods is nonetheless likely to improve the scientific contributions of MR studies.},

The Bayley III scales have used widely globally but it has not been validated for Sri Lankan children. We administered the Cognitive and Motor Scales of the Bayley III to 150 full-term children aged 6, 12 and 24 months from the Gampaha District of Sri Lanka. We compared the performance of Sri Lankan children 6, 12 and 24 months of age on the cognitive and motor scales of the Bayley III with that of US children.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nRESULTS: Compared to the US norms, at 12 months, Sri Lankan children had significantly higher cognitive scores and lower gross motor scores, and at 24 months significantly lower cognitive scores. The test had a high test-retest reliability among Sri Lankan children.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSIONS: There were small differences in the cognitive and motors scores between Sri Lankan and US children. It is feasible to use Bayley III scales to assess neurodevelopment of Sri Lankan children. However, we recommend that the tool be validated using a larger representative sample of all population groups.},

Pro-inflammatory cytokines, stimulated during inflammatory response, have a pleotrophic effect on neurons and glia cells. They act in a dose-dependent manner, activate cell-death pathways and also act as trophic factors. In the present study, we have examined in mice the effect of short, systemic maternal inflammation on fetal brain development. Maternal inflammation, induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) at gestation day 17, did not affect morphogenic parameters and reflex development during the first month of life. However, maternal inflammation specifically increased the number of pyramidal and granular cells in the hippocampus, as well as the shrinkage of pyramidal cells, but not of the granular cells. No additional major morphological differences were observed in the cerebral cortex or cerebellum. In accordance with the morphological effects, maternal inflammation specifically impaired distinct forms of learning and memory, but not motor function or exploration in the adult offspring. The specific deficiency observed, following maternal inflammation, may suggest particular sensitivity of the hippocampus and other associated brain regions to inflammatory factors during late embryonic development. \textcopyright{} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

We studied the relationship between heart transplant waiting time and transplant failure (removal from the waitlist, pretransplant death, or death or graft failure within 1 year) to determine the risk that conservative donor heart acceptance practices confer in terms of increasing the risk of failure among patients awaiting transplantation. Methods: We studied a cohort of 28,283 adults registered on the United Network for Organ Sharing heart transplant waiting list between 2000 and 2010. We used Kaplan-Meier methods with inverse probability censoring weights to examine the risk of transplant failure accumulated over time spent on the waiting list (pretransplant). In addition, we used transplant candidate blood type as an instrumental variable to assess the risk of transplant failure associated with increased wait time. Results: Our results show that those who wait longer for a transplant have greater odds of transplant failure. While on the waitlist, the greatest risk of failure is during the first 60 days. Doubling the amount of time on the waiting list was associated with a 10\% (1.01, 1.20) increase in the odds of failure within 1 year after transplantation. Conclusions: Our findings suggest a relationship between time spent on the waiting list and transplant failure, thereby supporting research aimed at defining adequate donor heart quality and acceptance standards for heart transplantation.},

Women affected by LS present a 40\% to 60\% lifetime risk of endometrial cancer (EC).\textbackslash n\textbackslash nOBJECTIVE: This case-case study aims to determine the frequency of the hMLH1, hMSH2, and hMSH6 MMR proteins and the factors (age, family history of cancer [FHC] related to LS, and body mass index [BMI]) associated to their absence in EC patients attending the University District Hospital of San Juan, Puerto Rico.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty cases were preliminary evaluated for the MMR protein expression by immunohistochemistry testing and classified as positive cases (presence of protein) or negative cases (absence of protein). The statistical analysis was based on the logistic regression model using the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). The Bayesian approach was used to determine the posterior probability (posterior Pr[odds ratio \{OR\} {$>$} 1]).\textbackslash n\textbackslash nRESULTS: Results showed absence for at least 1 MMR protein in 25\% of the cases, 15\% for hMLH1, and 10\% for hMSH2. None of the cases showed an absence for hMSH6. The MLE demonstrated that women diagnosed with EC before the age of 50 (OR: 12.4; 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 0.5-322.7), having FHC related to LS (OR: 17.7; 95\% CI = 0.6-534.6), and having lower BMI (OR: 2.38; 95\% CI = 0.39-14.28) present higher odds than their counterparts of lacking an MMR protein, once adjusted for potential predictors (P {$>$} 0.05). The posterior probability that an excess risk of lacking an MMR protein occurs was 95\% or greater for each predictor.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSIONS: Our study in this Hispanic population supports previous studies in that younger age, FHC, and lower BMI are associated with increased odds of having an absence of MMR protein expression. Further studies with larger sample sizes should be performed.},

AhR is expressed at high levels in several human breast carcinoma cell lines in direct correlation with the degree of their malignancy. Recent studies suggest a possible role for AhR in cancer independent of PAH. Therefore, we established stable AhR knockdown cells of the human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 and analyzed their tumorigenic properties in in vitro and in vivo model systems. In addition we analyzed their response to radiation and chemotherapeutic treatment. AhR knockdown attenuated these cells tumorigenic properties in vitro including proliferation, anchorage independent growth, migration and apoptosis and reduced orthotopic xenograft tumor growth and lung metastasis in vivo. Notably, we observed that AhR knockdown enhanced radiation-induced apoptosis as well as significantly decreased cell clonogenic survival. Furthermore, AhR knockdown in MDA-MB-231 cells sensitized them to paclitaxel treatment, evident by a decrease in the required cytotoxic dose. Subsequent analysis revealed AhR knockdown significantly reduced phosphorylation of AKT, which impacts cell proliferation and survival. Apoptosis-focused gene expression analyses revealed an altered expression of genes regulating apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells. Collectively, our data identify AhR as a potential novel therapeutic target in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer.},

The p value was meant to be a flexible inferential measure, whereas the hypothesis test was a rule for behavior, not inference. The combination of the two methods has led to a reinterpretation of the p value simultaneously as an ``observed error rate'' and as a measure of evidence. Both of these interpretations are problematic, and their combination has obscured the important differences between Neyman and Fisher on the nature of the scientific method and inhibited our understanding of the philosophic implications of the basic methods in use today. An analysis using another method promoted by Fisher, mathematical likelihood, shows that the p value substantially overstates the evidence against the null hypothesis. Likelihood makes clearer the distinction between error rates and inferential evidence and is a quantitative tool for expressing evidential strength that is more appropriate for the purposes of epidemiology than the p value.},

  abstract = {An important problem exists in the interpretation of modern medical research data: Biological understanding and previous research play little formal role in the interpretation of quantitative results. This phenomenon is manifest in the discussion sections of research articles and ultimately can affect the reliability of conclusions. The standard statistical approach has created this situation by promoting the illusion that conclusions can be produced with certain "error rates," without consideration of information from outside the experiment. This statistical approach, the key components of which are P values and hypothesis tests, is widely perceived as a mathematically coherent approach to inference. There is little appreciation in the medical community that the methodology is an amalgam of incompatible elements, whose utility for scientific inference has been the subject of intense debate among statisticians for almost 70 years. This article introduces some of the key elements of that debate and traces the appeal and adverse impact of this methodology to the P value fallacy, the mistaken idea that a single number can capture both the long-run outcomes of an experiment and the evidential meaning of a single result. This argument is made as a prelude to the suggestion that another measure of evidence should be used--the Bayes factor, which properly separates issues of long-run behavior from evidential strength and allows the integration of background knowledge with statistical findings.},

Despite an increasing prevalence of chronic childhood conditions and heightened concerns for the quality of life of the chronically ill, population-based studies of behavior problems among children with chronic physical conditions are rare. Findings on the epidemiology of behavior problems in a nationally representative sample of 11,699 children and adolescents aged 4 to 17 years in the United States are reported. Data included a 32-item parent-reported behavior problem index, measures of chronic childhood conditions, measures of school placement and performance, and sociodemographic variables. Analyses confirmed that chronic physical conditions were a significant risk factor for behavior problems, independent of sociodemographic variables. Among children these differences were observed across all subscales; among adolescents the largest differences were found for the Depression/Anxiety and Peer Conflict/Social Withdrawal subscales. Rates of extreme behavior problem scores (those in the top 10th percentile) were 1.55 times higher among children with a chronic health condition compared with children without a chronic condition (95\% confidence interval 1.29 to 1.86). These independent odds were lowered to 1.44 when covariates for confounding were introduced via a multivariate logistic regression. Other independent risks included the absence of either biologic parent (odds ratio 2.05), male gender (1.53), low vs high family income (1.30), low vs high maternal education (1.51), and young vs old maternal age at childbirth (2.57). Chronic health conditions were also a major risk factor for placement in special education classes and having to repeat grades. Despite evidence for effective interventions, health services for children with chronic conditions--particularly mental health services--remain fragmented, signaling the need for increased attention to behavioral problems and their treatment among all health professionals caring for children.},

The adult offspring prenatally treated with LPS showed a decrease in the proliferating cells and the newborn neurons of the dentate gyrus. Furthermore, prenatal LPS treatment impaired performance in the neurogenesis-dependent novel object recognition test. Maternal care was impaired by prenatal LPS administration but did not contribute to the effects of prenatal LPS on adult neurogenesis. Persistent microglial activation and downregulated expression of transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF{$\beta$}(1)) occurred specifically in the adult hippocampus of animals treated prenatally with LPS. Importantly, chronic hippocampal TGF{$\beta$}(1) overexpression restored neurogenesis as well as recognition memory performance to control levels. These findings demonstrate that prenatal inflammation triggered by LPS impairs adult neurogenesis and recognition memory. Furthermore, we provide a model of reduced adult neurogenesis with long-lasting defined alterations in the neurogenic niche. Finally, we show that the expression of a single cytokine (TGF{$\beta$}(1)) in the hippocampus can restore adult neurogenesis and its related behavior, highlighting the role of TGF{$\beta$}(1) in these processes.},

The Weibull model allows the investigator to specify a group difference in terms of a hazards ratio or a failure time ratio. We consider exponential, Weibull and uniformly distributed censoring distributions. We base our power calculations on a parametric approach with the Wald test because it is easy for medical investigators to conceptualize and specify the required input variables. As expected, studies with current status data have substantially less power than studies with the usual right-censored failure time data. Our simulation results demonstrate the merits of these proposed power calculations.},

To address this problem, a diet and activity intervention during pregnancy, which was based on social learning theory, was initiated in 4 Cree communities. METHODS: A prospective intervention compared dietary, weight and glycemic indicators for 107 control subjects and for 112 women who received the intervention during the course of their pregnancy. A control period in 4 communities (July 1995-March 1996) was followed by an intervention period (April 1996-January 1997) when subjects were offered regular, individual diet counselling, physical activity sessions and other activities related to nutrition. RESULTS: The intervention and control groups did not differ at baseline regarding their mean age (24.3 years [SD 6.29] v. 23.8 years [SD 5.86]), mean prepregnancy weight (81.0 kg [SD 19.46] v. 78.9 kg [SD 17.54]) and mean gestational age at recruitment (17.1 weeks [SD 7.06] v. 18.5 weeks [SD 6.92]). The intervention did not result in differences in diet measured at 24-30 weeks' gestation, rate of weight gain over the second half of pregnancy (0.53 kg per week [SD 0.32] v. 0.53 kg per week [SD 0.27]) or plasma glucose level (50 g oral glucose screen) between 24 and 30 weeks (7.21 mmol/L [SD 2.09] v. 7.43 mmol/L [SD 2.10]). Mean birth weights were similar (3741 g [SD 523] v. 3686 g [SD 686]), as was maternal weight at 6 weeks post partum (88.1 kg [SD 16.8] v. 86.4 kg [SD 19.0]). The only changes in dietary intake were a reduction in caffeine (pregnancy) and an increase in folate (post partum). INTERPRETATION: This intervention had only a minor impact on diet; finding ways of encouraging appropriate body weight and activity levels remains a challenge.},

Of 61,895 women entering the Danish National Birth Cohort and completing the first data-collection phase, 37,178 (60\%) opted to be in the 7-year follow-up. Using national registry data to obtain end point information on all members of the cohort, we estimated associations in the baseline and the 7-year follow-up participant populations for 5 exposure-outcome associations: (a) size at birth and childhood asthma, (b) assisted reproductive treatment and childhood hospitalizations, (c) prepregnancy body mass index and childhood infections, (d) alcohol drinking in early pregnancy and childhood developmental disorders, and (e) maternal smoking in pregnancy and childhood attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). We estimated follow-up bias in the odds or rate ratios by calculating relative ratios. For all but one of the above analyses, the bias appeared to be small, between -10\% and +8\%. For maternal smoking in pregnancy and childhood ADHD, we estimated a positive bias of approximately 33\% (95\% bootstrap limits of -30\% and +152\%). The presence and magnitude of bias due to loss to follow-up depended on the nature of the factors or outcomes examined, with the most pronounced contribution in this study coming from maternal smoking. Our methods and results may inform bias analyses in future pregnancy cohort studies.},

Numerical examples demonstrate that the observed results of both conventional and alternative studies are mutually compatible with a broad range of true values of the association under study, and that there is no a priori basis for assuming that either set of results is closer to the true value.

A seemingly unrelated problem in epidemiology is that of confounding: bias in estimation of the effects of an exposure on disease risk, due to inherent differences in risk between exposed and unexposed individuals. Using a simple deterministic model for exposure effects, a logical connection is drawn between the concepts of identifiability, exchangeability, and confounding. This connection allows one to view the problem of confounding as arising from problems of identifiability, and reveals the exchangeability assumptions that are implicit in confounder control methods. It also provides further justification for confounder definitions based on comparability of exposure groups, as opposed to collapsibility-based definitions.},

It appears that the excess fraction (like incidence proportion) will be most relevant in situations that require only consideration of whether disease occurs by a particular time. In situations that require consideration of when disease occurs, direct measures of effect on incidence time may be as relevant as or more relevant than any attributable fraction. To avoid technical complications, we have not discussed additional problems of causal attribution that can arise when exposure has multiple levels or is sustained over time, and the estimation problems that can arise when considering case-control studies, competing risks, or differential censoring.

Site-specific cancer deaths among active or retired employees were cases; controls were selected from deaths (primarily cardiovascular deaths) presumed to be unassociated with any of the study exposures. Using job records, we then computed person-years of exposure for each subject. All subjects were white males. The only unequivocal association was that of resin systems with lung cancer (odds ratio = 2.2 at 16.6 years of exposure, P = 0.001, in a multiple logistic regression including asbestos, age, year of death, and year of hire). Certain other odds ratios appeared larger, but no other association was so robust and remained as distinct after considering the multiplicity of comparisons. Study power was very limited for most associations, and several biases may have affected our results. Nevertheless, further investigation of synthetic resin systems of the type used in the study plant appears warranted.},

While simple methods such as stratification on missing-data status, conditional-mean imputation, and complete-subject analysis are commonly employed for handling this problem, several studies have shown that these methods can be biased under reasonable circumstances. The authors review these results in the context of logistic regression and present simulation experiments showing the limitations of the methods. The method based on missing-data indicators can exhibit severe bias even when the data are missing completely at random, and regression (conditional-mean) imputation can be inordinately sensitive to model misspecification. Even complete-subject analysis can outperform these methods. More sophisticated methods, such as maximum likelihood, multiple imputation, and weighted estimating equations, have been given extensive attention in the statistics literature. While these methods are superior to simple methods, they are not commonly used in epidemiology, no doubt due to their complexity and the lack of packaged software to apply these methods. The authors contrast the results of multiple imputation to simple methods in the analysis of a case-control study of endometrial cancer, and they find a meaningful difference in results for age at menarche. In general, the authors recommend that epidemiologists avoid using the missing-indicator method and use more sophisticated methods whenever a large proportion of data are missing.},

In a case crossover analysis, confounding by fixed (constant) characteristics is eliminated by pairing of cases to themselves, at the possible cost of introducing bias due to time trends in exposure. A case-time-control analysis can correct case-crossover results only for bias due to such time trends. If an uncontrolled confounder (such as disease severity) is present, the use of time controls can introduce new con founding, and the case time control results may end up either more or less confounded than the ordinary and case crossover results. The relative confounding in the different approaches depends on details of the relations among the unmeasured confounder, the study exposure, the study disease, and any trend in these variables or their effects. Like an ordinary study, a case-time-control study must assume absence of unmeasured confounders, whether fixed or time-varying. Like a case-crossover study, it must also assume absence of carryover effects and can be more prone to misclassification bias than an ordinary study.},

This paper reviews basic methods for examining the sensitivity of study results to biases, with a focus on methods that can be implemented without computer programming. Conclusion. Sensitivity analysis is helpful in obtaining a realistic picture of the potential impact of biases.},

We provide an introduction to these developments and their use in epidemiologic research. Causal diagrams can provide a starting point for identifying variables that must be measured and controlled to obtain unconfounded effect estimates. They also provide a method for critical evaluation of traditional epidemiologic criteria for confounding. In particular, they reveal certain heretofore unnoticed shortcomings of those criteria when used in considering multiple potential confounders. We show how to modify the traditional criteria to correct those shortcomings.},

More recently it has been shown that stratifying on a variable that precedes exposure and disease can induce confounding, even if there is no confounding in the unstratified (crude) estimate. This paper examines the relative magnitudes of these biases under some simple causal models in which the stratification variable is graphically depicted as a collider (a variable directly affected by two or more other variables in the graph). The results suggest that bias from stratifying on variables affected by exposure and disease may often be comparable in size with bias from classical confounding (bias from failing to stratify on a common cause of exposure and disease), whereas other biases from collider stratification may tend to be much smaller.},

  abstract = {One misconception (of many) about Bayesian analyses is that prior distributions introduce assumptions that are more questionable than assumptions made by frequentist methods; yet the assumptions in priors can be more reasonable than the assumptions implicit in standard frequentist models. Another misconception is that Bayesian methods are computationally difficult and require special software. But perfectly adequate Bayesian analyses can be carried out with common software for frequentist analysis. Under a wide range of priors, the accuracy of these approximations is just as good as the frequentist accuracy of the software--and more than adequate for the inaccurate observational studies found in health and social sciences. An easy way to do Bayesian analyses is via inverse-variance (information) weighted averaging of the prior with the frequentist estimate. A more general method expresses the prior distributions in the form of prior data or 'data equivalents', which are then entered in the analysis as a new data stratum. That form reveals the strength of the prior judgements being introduced and may lead to tempering of those judgements. It is argued that a criterion for scientific acceptability of a prior distribution is that it be expressible as prior data, so that the strength of prior assumptions can be gauged by how much data they represent.},

These methods provide an alternative to the parsimony-oriented approach of frequentist regression analysis. In particular, they replace arbitrary variable-selection criteria by prior distributions, and by doing so facilitate realistic use of imprecise but important prior information. They also allow Bayesian analyses to be conducted using standard regression packages; one need only be able to add variables and records to the data set. The methods thus facilitate the use of Bayesian solutions to problems of sparse data, multiple comparisons, subgroup analyses and study bias. Because these solutions have a frequentist interpretation as "shrinkage" (penalized) estimators, the methods can also be viewed as a means of implementing shrinkage approaches to multiparameter problems.},

The analyses can easily incorporate any complete ('validation' or second-stage) data that might be available, as well as adjustments for confounding and selection bias. The approach illustrates how conventional analyses depend on implicit certainty that bias parameters are null and how these implausible assumptions can be replaced by plausible priors for bias parameters.

We illustrate these limitations in the case of random confounding and designs that prevent such confounding. In many experimental designs individual treatment allocations are dependent, and explicit population models are needed to show this dependency. In particular, certain designs impose unfaithful covariate-treatment distributions to prevent random confounding, yet ordinary causal graphs cannot discriminate between these unconfounded designs and confounded studies. Causal models for populations are better suited for displaying these phenomena than are individual-level models, because they allow representation of allocation dependencies as well as outcome dependencies across individuals. Nonetheless, even with this extension, ordinary graphical models still fail to capture distinctions between hypothetical superpopulations (sampling distributions) and observed populations (actual distributions), although potential-outcome models can be adapted to show these distinctions and their consequences.},

  abstract = {Misinterpretation and abuse of statistical tests, confidence intervals, and statistical power have been decried for decades, yet remain rampant. A key problem is that there are no interpretations of these concepts that are at once simple, intuitive, correct, and foolproof. Instead, correct use and interpretation of these statistics requires an attention to detail which seems to tax the patience of working scientists. This high cognitive demand has led to an epidemic of shortcut definitions and interpretations that are simply wrong, sometimes disastrously so\textemdash and yet these misinterpretations dominate much of the scientific literature. In light of this problem, we provide definitions and a discussion of basic statistics that are more general and critical than typically found in traditional introductory expositions. Our goal is to provide a resource for instruc-tors, researchers, and consumers of statistics whose knowledge of statistical theory and technique may be limited but who wish to avoid and spot misinterpretations. We emphasize how violation of often unstated analysis protocols (such as selecting analyses for presentation based on the P values they produce) can lead to small P values even if the declared test hypothesis is correct, and can lead to large P values even if that hypothesis is incorrect. We then provide an explanatory list of 25 misinterpretations of P values, confidence intervals, and power. We conclude with guidelines for improving statistical interpretation and reporting.

There seem to be misconceptions about the requirements and capabilities of formal methods, especially in notions that certain assumptions or models (such as potential-outcome models) are necessary or sufficient for valid inference. I argue that, once these misconceptions are removed, most elements of the opposing views can be reconciled. The chief problem of causal inference then becomes one of how to teach sound use of formal methods (such as causal modeling, statistical inference, and sensitivity analysis), and how to apply them without generating the overconfidence and misinterpretations that have ruined so many statistical practices.},

Using simulated data, the authors compared 3 methods to handle missing outcome data: 1) complete case analysis; 2) single imputation; and 3) multiple imputation (all 3 with and without covariate adjustment). Simulated scenarios focused on continuous or dichotomous missing outcome data from randomized trials or observational studies. When outcomes were missing at random, single and multiple imputations yielded unbiased estimates after covariate adjustment. Estimates obtained by complete case analysis with covariate adjustment were unbiased as well, with coverage close to 95\%. When outcome data were missing not at random, all methods gave biased estimates, but handling missing outcome data by means of 1 of the 3 methods reduced bias compared with a complete case analysis without covariate adjustment. Complete case analysis with covariate adjustment and multiple imputation yield similar estimates in the event of missing outcome data, as long as the same predictors of missingness are included. Hence, complete case analysis with covariate adjustment can and should be used as the analysis of choice more often. Multiple imputation, in addition, can accommodate the missing-not-at-random scenario more flexibly, making it especially suited for sensitivity analyses. \textcopyright{} 2011 The Author.},

Estimation of the parameters of a marginal structural model is also available. The package allows outcome data with missingness, and experimental units that contribute repeated records of the point-treatment data structure, thereby allowing the analysis of longitudinal data structures. Relevant factors of the likelihood may be modeled or fit data-adaptively according to user specifications, or passed in from an external estimation procedure.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To examine the prevalence and pattern of specific areas of learning disability (LD) in neurologically normal children with extremely low birth weight (ELBW) ({$<$} or = 800 g) who have broadly average intelligence compared with full-term children with normal birth weight of comparable sociodemographic background, and to explore concurrent cognitive correlates of the specific LDs. DESIGN: Longitudinal follow-up; geographically defined region. SETTING: Regional follow-up program. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised, Gray Oral Reading Test-Revised, Test of Written Language-Revised, Wide Range Achievement Test-Revised, Developmental Test of Visual-Motor Integration. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred fourteen (87\%) of 131 children with ELBW born between 1982 and 1987 were seen at ages 8 to 9 years. Of the 114 children, 74, who were neurologically normal, with a Verbal or Performance IQ greater than or equal to 85, formed the study group. A group of 30 full-term children with normal birth weight and similar sociodemographic status comprised a comparison group. The children were predominantly white and middle class. RESULTS: Significantly more children with ELBW (65\%) met criteria for LD in 1 or more areas compared with 13\% of the comparison children. In the ELBW group, the most frequently affected area was written output, then arithmetic, then reading. Visuospatial and visual-motor abilities in combination with verbal functioning primarily explained performance in arithmetic and reading among children with ELBW, unlike the control children, whose scores were associated only with verbal functioning. CONCLUSIONS: Complex LDs in multiple academic domains are common sequelae among broadly middle class, predominantly white, neurologically normal children with ELBW compared with control peers. The developmental etiology of LDs in children with ELBW and control peers differs.},

  abstract = {Purpose: The aim of this systematic review was to examine and compare differences in the way medication exposures are classified in studies using linked administrative data to investigate outcomes following medication use during pregnancy. This was undertaken with a focus on studies investigating specific neonatal outcomes following prenatal exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Methods: We searched Medline and Embase to identify studies that used linked administrative data to investigate specific neonatal outcomes (congenital malformations, birth weight, gestational age) following prenatal exposure to SSRIs. Results: Key factors such as dose, duration and timing of exposure were inconsistently addressed in the studies identified. In addition, there was a great deal of variability in the way medication exposures were classified and how women who stop taking their medication before or during early pregnancy are handled in analyses. Furthermore, there are issues in assuming how and when women who receive a dispensing for a medication actually take it during pregnancy. This creates a great deal of uncertainty around medication exposure during pregnancy in studies using linked administrative data, potentially resulting in biased risk estimates. Conclusions: There is a need for greater focus on determining the most effective and accurate way of using linked administrative data to investigate outcomes following medication use during pregnancy in an effort to minimise potential biases. \textcopyright{} Springer-Verlag 2011.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Although surgery is currently the treatment of choice for managing endometriosis, recurrence poses a formidable challenge. To delay or to eliminate the recurrence is presently an unmet medical need in the management of endometriosis. To this end, proposals to investigate patterns of recurrence, to develop biomarkers for recurrence and to carry out biomarker-based intervention have been made. METHODS Publications pertaining to the recurrence of endometriosis and its related yet unaddressed issues were identified through MEDLINE. The reported recurrence rates, risk factors for recurrence, the effects of post-operative medication and causes of recurrence were reviewed and synthesized. In addition, several poorly explored issues such as time hazard function and mechanisms of recurrence were reviewed. Approaches to the development of biomarkers for recurrence and future intervention are discussed. RESULTS The reported recurrence rate was high, estimated as 21.5\% at 2 years and 40-50\% at 5 years. Few risk factors for recurrence have been consistently identified, and the evidence on the efficacy of the post-operative use of medication was scanty. The investigation on the patterns of recurrence may provide us with new insight into the possible mechanisms of recurrence and its control. The attempt to identify biomarkers for recurrence has started only very recently. CONCLUSIONS Much research is needed to better understand the patterns of recurrence and risk factors, and to develop biomarkers. One top priority is to develop biomarkers for recurrence, which may provide much needed clues to the possible mechanisms underlying recurrence and would allow the identification of patients with high recurrence risk, and permit for targeted intervention.},

Main Outcome Measure(s) Systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP), cardiovascular function, body mass index (BMI), and lipid and glucose profiles. Result(s) We included 19 studies that had recruited 2,112 IVF-ICSI and 4,096 naturally conceived offspring, ranging from childhood to early adulthood. The blood pressure levels of IVF-ICSI offspring were statistically significantly higher than those of naturally conceived offspring (weighted mean differences and confidence intervals: 1.88~mm Hg [95\% CI, 0.27, 3.49] for SBP and 1.51~mm Hg [95\% CI, 0.33, 2.70] for DBP). In addition, cardiac diastolic function was suboptimal and vessel thickness was higher among IVF-ICSI offspring. Compared with the metabolism of naturally conceived offspring, IVF-ICSI offspring displayed comparable BMI, lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, and higher fasting insulin levels. Conclusion(s) Children conceived by IVF-ICSI manifested a minor yet statistically significant increase in blood pressure without the clustering of increased BMI or impaired lipid metabolism by early adulthood. Our findings indicate a risk of cardiovascular disease among IVF-ICSI offspring, which calls for longer-term follow-ups and further investigation.},

To this end, we consider all nine combinations under, respectively, parametric, nonparametric and semiparametric structures. The comparisons provide useful information on when and how to efficiently utilize the model structures in practice. Further, when there is model-misspecification, either propensity score or outcome regression, we also give the corresponding comparisons. Three phenomena are observed. Firstly, when all models are correctly specified, any combination can achieve the same semiparametric efficiency bound, which coincides with the existing results of some combinations. Secondly, when the propensity score is correctly modeled and estimated, but the outcome regression is misspecified parametrically or semiparametrically, the asymptotic variance is always larger than or equal to the semiparametric efficiency bound. Thirdly, in contrast, when the propensity score is misspecified parametrically or semiparametrically, while the outcome regression is correctly modeled and estimated, the asymptotic variance is not necessarily larger than the semiparametric efficiency bound. In some cases, the "super-efficiency" phenomenon occurs. We also conduct a small numerical study.},

Empirical data from throughout Africa on associations between placental malaria and birth weight outcome, birth weight outcome and infant mortality, and the rates of LBW in areas with various levels of malaria transmission are evaluated to assess the increased risks of LBW and infant mortality associated with malaria. It is estimated that in areas where malaria is endemic, around 19\% of infant LBWs are due to malaria and 6\% of infant deaths are due to LBW caused by malaria. These estimates imply that around 100,000 infant deaths each year could be due to LBW caused by malaria during pregnancy in areas of malaria endemicity in Africa.},

The assessment of mediation is an important tool for addressing this criticism. By using mediation analysis to open the black box, underlying mechanisms of the observed associations can be described and causal inference improved. An explicit theoretical motivation for such an analysis has been missing from the epidemiological literature. To provide this motivation, we integrate literature from epidemiology and other social sciences to describe the reasons that an investigator might want to assess mediation. We then describe the connections between these reasons and specific measures of indirect and direct effects that have been previously described. \textcopyright{} Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the International Epidemiological Association \textcopyright{} The Author 2009; all rights reserved.},

However, little work has been done to quantify the bias caused by this type of unmeasured confounding and determine whether this bias will materially affect conclusions regarding mediation. The author developed a sensitivity analysis program to address this crucial issue. Data from 2 well-known studies in the methodological literature on mediation were reanalyzed using this program. The results of mediation analyses were found not to be as vulnerable to the impact of confounding as previously described; however, these findings varied sharply between the 2 studies. Although the indirect effect observed in one study could potentially be due to a cause common to both the mediator and the outcome, such confounding could not feasibly explain the results of the other study. These disparate results demonstrate the utility of the current sensitivity analysis when assessing mediation.},

Study design We studied cases of gastroschisis ascertained from the regional fetal congenital anomaly register.

The first control was the next mother to deliver in the hospital, representing the normal population of mothers. The second control was the next mother to deliver an unaffected child whose age was within one year of that of the index case controlling for maternal age. Results There was a strong inverse association between maternal age and gastroschisis. An inverse association between gastroschisis and birth order was eliminated by adjustment for maternal age. The average age of mothers of affected children was 22.1 years; of the next delivery control was 28.8 years, and of the age matched control was 22.2 years. A weak non-statistically significant negative association between BMI and gastroschisis was further weakened by adjustment for maternal age. Conclusion Our results confirm the previously reported association between low maternal age and gastroschisis but suggest that within our UK population the link between low BMI and gastroschisis reported elsewhere is explained by younger mothers being thinner.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Knowledge of the relative contributions of risk factors in predicting young children's behavior problems may provide insights for the development of preventive interventions. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to identify maternal predictors of children's internalizing and externalizing behaviors in a volunteer sample of 205 low-income, single mothers with children between 2 and 6 years of age. METHOD: Data were collected on chronic stressors, self-esteem, negative thinking, depressive symptoms, and child behavior during in-home interviews with the mothers. RESULTS: Mothers' reports of internalizing and externalizing behaviors did not differ by sex or race of the child. Chronic stressors and depressive symptoms, in addition to control variables, explained 27\% of the variability in internalizing behavior while these two variables accounted for 21\% of the variability in externalizing behavior. For both internalizing and externalizing behavior, chronic stressors exerted the largest total effects. The effects of self-esteem and negative thinking were indirect, with the latter playing a stronger role. The indirect effect of negative thinking on child behavior was exerted through depressive symptoms, while self-esteem was linked with child behavior through both negative thinking and depressive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Decreasing mothers' negative thinking, a variable amenable to intervention, may not only decrease a mother's depressive symptoms but also improve her perception of the child's behavior. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Decreasing mothers' negative thinking may provide a way to reduce their depressive symptoms and result in fewer behavior problems among their young children. Nurses working in primary care and community-based settings are in key positions to address this problem and improve the mental health of low-income mothers and positively affect the behavior of their children.},

These findings reflect, in part, the pharmaceutical intractability of processes involved in the metastatic process and highlight the need to identify additional drug targets for the treatment of late-stage disease. In the current study, we report that ligand activation of the aryl-hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) inhibits multiple aspects of the metastatic process in a panel of breast cancer cell lines that represent the major breast cancer subtypes. Specifically, it was observed that treatment with exogenous AhR agonists significantly inhibited cell invasiveness and motility in the Boyden chamber assay and inhibited colony formation in soft agar regardless of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor, or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 status. Knockdown of the AhR using small interfering RNA duplexes demonstrated that the inhibition of invasiveness was receptor dependent and that endogenous receptor activity was protective in each cell type examined. The inhibition of invasiveness and anchorage-independent growth correlated with the ability of exogenous AhR agonists to promote differentiation. Finally, exogenous AhR agonists were able to promote differentiation in a putative mammary cancer stem cell line. Cumulatively, these results suggest that the AhR plays an important role in mammary epithelial differentiation and, as such, represent a promising therapeutic target for a range of phenotypically distinct human breast cancers.},

  abstract = {Background Reproductive factors reflective of endogenous sex hormone exposure might have an effect on cardiac remodeling and the development of heart failure (HF). Objectives This study examined the association between key reproductive factors and the incidence of HF. Methods Women from a cohort of the Women's Health Initiative were systematically evaluated for the incidence of HF hospitalization from study enrollment through 2014. Reproductive factors (number of live births, age at first pregnancy, and total reproductive duration [time from menarche to menopause]) were self-reported at study baseline in 1993 to 1998. We employed Cox proportional hazards regression analysis in age- and multivariable-adjusted models. Results Among 28,516 women, with an average age of 62.7 {$\pm$} 7.1 years at baseline, 1,494 (5.2\%) had an adjudicated incident HF hospitalization during an average follow-up of 13.1 years. After adjusting for covariates, total reproductive duration in years was inversely associated with incident HF: hazard ratios (HRs) of 0.99 per year (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 0.98 to 0.99 per year) and 0.95 per 5 years (95\% CI: 0.91 to 0.99 per 5 years). Conversely, early age at first pregnancy and nulliparity were significantly associated with incident HF in age-adjusted models, but not after multivariable adjustment. Notably, nulliparity was associated with incident HF with preserved ejection fraction in the fully adjusted model (HR: 2.75; 95\% CI: 1.16 to 6.52). Conclusions In post-menopausal women, shorter total reproductive duration was associated with higher risk~of~incident HF, and nulliparity was associated with higher risk for incident HF with preserved ejection fraction. Whether~exposure to endogenous sex hormones underlies this relationship should be investigated in future studies.},

In this study, our aim was to assess the occurrence of this bias and to evaluate whether it is remedied by including a control group (the case-time-control design). Using Danish data resources from 1995-2012, we conducted case-crossover and case-time-control analyses for 3 medications (statins, insulin, and thyroxine) in relation to 3 outcomes (retinal detachment, wrist fracture, and ischemic stroke), all with assumed null associations. Controls were matched on age, sex, and index date, and exposure over the preceding 12 months was ascertained. For retinal detachment, the case-crossover odds ratio was 1.60 (95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.42, 1.80) for statins, 1.40 (95\% CI: 1.02, 1.92) for thyroxine, and 1.53 (95\% CI: 1.04, 2.24) for insulin. Estimates for the retinal detachment controls were similar, leading to near-null case-time-control estimates for all 3 medication classes. For wrist fracture and stroke, the odds ratios were higher for cases than for controls, and case-time-control odds ratios were consistently above unity, thus implying significant residual bias. In casecrossover studies of medications, contamination by persistent users confers a moderate bias upward, which is partly remedied by using a control group. The optimal strategy for dealing with this problem is currently unknown.},

It has a natural interpretation for discrete-time sequences but is also widely used for life-history data, which are continuous in time. Life-history data are arguably better dealt with in terms of episodes rather than as strings of time-unit observations, and in this article, the author examines whether the OM algorithm is unsuitable for such sequences. A modified version of the algorithm is proposed, weighting OM's elementary operations inversely with episode length. In the general case, the modified algorithm produces pairwise distances much lower than the standard algorithm, the more the sequences are composed of long spells in the same state. However, where all the sequences in a data set consist of few long spells, and there is low variability in the number of spells, the modified algorithm generates an overall pattern of distances that is not very different from standard OM.},

Additionally, unique associations between exposure to community violence and reactive and proactive aggression, two widely-studied forms of aggression, in the context of parental involvement has yet to be examined. One population that may be of particular interest for such an investigation is immigrant adolescents, a population at increased risk of experiencing community violence and developing aggression. The current study therefore examined the joint and interactive contribution of community violence and parental involvement in the explanation of reactive and proactive forms of aggression among 81 immigrant adolescents (M age = 15.44). As expected, exposure to community violence was positively associated with both reactive and proactive aggression. Parental involvement, however, was not associated with either form of aggression. Further, the association between exposure to community violence and proactive aggression was found to vary by level of parental involvement. Contrary to expectations, when levels of parental involvement were high, there was a positive association between exposure to community violence and proactive aggression and no association when levels of parental involvement were low. Results have important implications for understanding unique developmental pathways and distinct correlates of reactive and proactive aggression among immigrant adolescents.

Notwithstanding this, there appears to have been little emphasis placed on potential selection bias in published reports from population-based neuropathological studies of dementia. Methods: We provide an overview of methodological issues relating to the identification of and adjustment for selection bias. When information is available on factors that govern selection, inverse-probability weighting provides an analytic approach to adjust for selection bias. The weights help alleviate bias by serving to bridge differences between the population from which the observed data may be viewed as a representative sample and the target population, identified as being of scientific interest. Results: We illustrate the methods with data obtained from the Adult Changes in Thought study. Adjustment for potential selection bias yields substantially strengthened association between neuropathological measurements and risk of dementia. Conclusions: Armed with analytic techniques to adjust for selection bias and to ensure generalizability of results from population-based neuropathological studies, researchers should consider incorporating information related to selection into their data collection schemes.

  abstract = {Comparative effectiveness research (CER) aims to provide patients and physicians with evidence-based guidance on treatment decisions. As researchers conduct CER they face myriad challenges. Although inadequate control of confounding is the most-often cited source of potential bias, selection bias that arises when patients are differentially excluded from analyses is a distinct phenomenon with distinct consequences: confounding bias compromises internal validity, whereas selection bias compromises external validity. Despite this distinction, however, the label "treatment-selection bias" is being used in the CER literature to denote the phenomenon of confounding bias. Motivated by an ongoing study of treatment choice for depression on weight change over time, this paper formally distinguishes selection and confounding bias in CER. By formally distinguishing selection and confounding bias, this paper clarifies important scientific, design, and analysis issues relevant to ensuring validity. First is that the 2 types of biases may arise simultaneously in any given study; even if confounding bias is completely controlled, a study may nevertheless suffer from selection bias so that the results are not generalizable to the patient population of interest. Second is that the statistical methods used to mitigate the 2 biases are themselves distinct; methods developed to control one type of bias should not be expected to address the other. Finally, the control of selection and confounding bias will often require distinct covariate information. Consequently, as researchers plan future studies of comparative effectiveness, care must be taken to ensure that all data elements relevant to both confounding and selection bias are collected.},

  abstract = {Background: Bias due to missing data is a major concern in electronic health record (EHR)-based research. As part of an ongoing EHR-based study of weight change among patients treated for depression, we conducted a survey to investigate determinants of missingness in the available weight information and to evaluate the missing-at-random assumption. Methods: We identified 8,345 individuals enrolled in a large EHR-based health care system who had monotherapy treatment for depression from April 2008 to March 2010. A stratified sample of 1,153 individuals completed a detailed survey. Logistic regression was used to investigate determinants of whether a patient (1) had an opportunity to be weighed at treatment initiation (baseline), and (2) had a weight measurement recorded. Parallel analyses were conducted to investigate missingness during follow-up. Throughout, inverse-probability weighting was used to adjust for the design and survey nonresponse. Analyses were also conducted to investigate potential recall bias. Results: Missingness at baseline and during follow-up was associated with numerous factors not routinely collected in the EHR including whether or not the patient had ever chosen not to be weighed, external weight control activities, and self-reported baseline weight. Patient attitudes about their weight and perceptions regarding the potential impact of their depression treatment on weight were not related to missingness. Conclusion: Adopting a comprehensive strategy to investigate missingness early in the research process gives researchers information necessary to evaluate key assumptions. While the survey presented focuses on outcome data, the overarching strategy can be applied to any and all data elements subject to missingness.},

They corrected the observed hazard ratios for selection bias caused by what they postulated was the nonrepresentativeness of the participants in the National Health Interview Study that increased with age, obesity, and ill health. However, it is possible that their regression approach to remove the alleged bias has not produced, and in general cannot produce, sensible hazard ratio estimates. First, one must consider how many nonparticipants there might have been in each category of obesity and of age at entry and how much higher the mortality rates would have to be in nonparticipants than in participants in these same categories. What plausible set of numerical values would convert the ("biased") decreasingwith- age hazard ratios seen in the data into the ("unbiased") increasing-with-age ratios that they computed? Can these values be encapsulated in (and can sensible values be recovered from) 1 additional internal variable in a regression model? Second, one must examine the age pattern of the hazard ratios that have been adjusted for selection. Without the correction, the hazard ratios are attenuated with increasing age. With it, the hazard ratios at older ages are considerably higher, but those at younger ages are well below 1. Third, one must test whether the regression approach suggested by Masters et al. would correct the nonrepresentativeness that increased with age and ill health that I introduced into real and hypothetical data sets. I found that the approach did not recover the hazard ratio patterns present in the unselected data sets: The corrections overshot the target at older ages and undershot it at lower ages.},

Methods: The design of the study is a literature review. The patients were women included in 26 selected studies due to a diagnosis of infertility or a reproductive disorder associated with infertility. This study has no interventions, and the main outcome measure is the association between female infertility or a related diagnosis and psychiatric disorders, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer, cardiovascular disease, and metabolic dysfunction. Results: Female infertility and related reproductive disorders may have ramifications for women beyond reproductive health. An analysis of publications shows that women with infertility had higher rates of psychiatric disorders and endometrial cancer than the general population [1\textendash 10]. Data is conflicting about whether infertile women are at increased risk for breast cancer and ovarian cancer [7, 8, 10\textendash 20]. A generalized diagnosis of infertility was not clearly associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease or metabolic dysfunction, but women with infertility related to polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) do appear more likely to develop cardiovascular disease and metabolic disorders such as diabetes than the general population [16, 21\textendash 26]. Conclusions: Female infertility and associated diagnoses have overall health implications. Beyond treatment of patients' immediate reproductive needs, healthcare professionals must be aware of the broader health impact of specific causes of infertility in order to provide accurate counseling regarding long-term risk.},

  abstract = {Epidemiologic studies are frequently susceptible to missing information. Omitting observations with missing variables remains a common strategy in epidemiologic studies, yet this simple approach can often severely bias parameter estimates of interest if the values are not missing completely at random. Even when missingness is completely random, complete-case analysis can reduce the efficiency of estimated parameters, because large amounts of available data are simply tossed out with the incomplete observations. Alternative methods for mitigating the influence of missing information, such as multiple imputation, are becoming an increasing popular strategy in order to retain all available information, reduce potential bias, and improve efficiency in parameter estimation. In this paper, we describe the theoretical underpinnings of multiple imputation, and we illustrate application of this method as part of a collaborative challenge to assess the performance of various techniques for dealing with missing data (Am J Epidemiol. 2018;187(3):568-575). We detail the steps necessary to perform multiple imputation on a subset of data from the Collaborative Perinatal Project (1959-1974), where the goal is to estimate the odds of spontaneous abortion associated with smoking during pregnancy.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Exposure to polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) flame retardants is widespread, with 97\% of Americans having detectable levels. Although PBDEs have been associated with reproductive and hormonal effects in animals, no human studies have examined their association with fertility.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nOBJECTIVES: This study was designed to determine whether maternal concentrations of PBDEs in serum collected during pregnancy are associated with time to pregnancy and menstrual cycle characteristics.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nMETHODS: Pregnant women (n = 223) living in a low-income, predominantly Mexican-immigrant community in California were interviewed to determine how many months they took to become pregnant. Blood samples were collected and analyzed for PBDEs. PBDE concentrations were lipid adjusted and log10 transformed. Analyses were limited to PBDE congeners detected in {$>$} 75\% of the population (BDEs 47, 99, 100, 153). Cox proportional hazards models modified for discrete time were used to obtain fecundability odds ratios (fORs) for the association of PBDEs and time to pregnancy.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nRESULTS: We detected all four congeners in {$>$} 97\% of women. Increasing levels of BDEs 47, 99, 100, 153 and the sum of these four congeners were all associated with longer time to pregnancy. We observed significantly reduced fORs for BDE-100 [adjusted fOR = 0.6; 95\% confidence interval (CI), 0.4-0.9], BDE-153 (adjusted fOR = 0.5; 95\% CI, 0.3-0.8), and the sum of the four congeners (adjusted fOR = 0.7; 95\% CI, 0.5-1.0). PBDEs were not associated with menstrual cycle characteristics.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSIONS: We found significant decreases in fecundability associated with PBDE exposure in women.

  abstract = {Attitudes toward divorce are believed to play a critical role in marital quality and the probability of divorce later in life. They are traditionally understood to result from social, demographic and environmental factors, including personal experience in relationships, family values, religion and economic incentives. An alternative line of research suggests that genetically influenced psychological dispositions have an important role in divorce and other relationship attitudes as well. The integration of these two lines of research however, remains embryonic. Here we address this lacuna by exploring how social and genetic factors correlate with each other, and are modified by one another. Specifically, we find that environmental factors and life events, such as going through a divorce, moderate reported genetic influences on attitudes toward divorce. The reduction in the heritability of divorce attitudes by life events is complex however. We find that the genetic influence to select into or experience a divorce is correlated with the genetic influence toward divorce attitudes. In addition, we also identify notable sex differences in the effect of divorce itself on subsequent attitudes toward divorce. Specifically, the importance of personal experience increases among women, while the importance of familial factors increases for men.},

Methods HIV-1-infected adults ({$\geq$}15 years) initiated on first-line ART between November 2004 and September 2012, and who remained on initial therapy for at least 24 weeks before switching, were studied. Survival analyses were conducted to examine the effect of second-line ART on mortality and loss to follow-up in: (i) the whole cohort; (ii) all patients eligible for second-line ART by immunological failure (IF) and/or virological failure (VF) criteria; and (iii) patients eligible by VF criteria. Results In total, 47 296 HIV-infected patients [mean age 37.5 (SD 9.5) years, CD4 175 (SD 158) cells/mm 3 , 71\% female] were included in the analyses. Of these, 1760 (3.7\%) patients switched to second-line ART (incidence rate = 1.7/100 person-years). Higher rates of mortality were observed in switchers versus non-switchers in all patients and patients with ART failure using IF/VF criteria. Switching only protected against mortality in patients with ART failure defined virologically and with the highest level of adherence [switching versus non-switching; {$>$}95\% adherence; adjusted HR = 0.50 (95\% CI = 0.26-0.93); P = 0.03]. Conclusions Switching patients to second-line ART may only be beneficial in a select group of patients who are virologically monitored and demonstrate good adherence. Our data emphasize the need for routine viral load monitoring and aggressive adherence interventions in HIV programmes in sub-Saharan Africa.},

The purpose of this study was to identify risk factors for spontaneous preterm birth in Manitoba women, and to compare risk factors among Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal women. A case-control study was performed at two tertiary care hospitals in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada from October 1999 to December 2000. Cases delivered a live singleton infant at {$<$} 37 weeks gestation (n = 226; 36\% Aboriginal), while controls delivered between 37 and 42 weeks gestation (n = 458; 38\% Aboriginal). An interview was conducted with each subject on the postpartum unit, and information was collected from the health record. Using stratified analyses to control for race/ethnicity, several risk factors for preterm birth had a uniform effect measure across strata, while others demonstrated heterogeneity. After adjusting for other maternal characteristics in a multivariable logistic regression model, significant risk factors for all women included previous preterm birth, two or more previous spontaneous abortions, vaginal bleeding after 12 weeks gestation, gestational hypertension, antenatal hospitalisation, and prelabour rupture of membranes. In addition, potentially modifiable risk factors included low weight gain during pregnancy and inadequate prenatal care for all women, and high levels of perceived stress for Aboriginal women. These modifiable risk factors lend themselves to public health interventions, and should be targeted in future prevention efforts.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: International infant mortality rates vary widely. This variation has been attributed to many factors, including differential reporting. In the US, American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN), who generally have low socioeconomic status, have a low neonatal mortality rate. One possible explanation is underregistration of very low birthweight (VLBW, {$<$} 1,500 g) births. We hypothesized that underregistration may occur disproportionately among AI/AN residing on or near reservations (areas controlled by an American Indian group). We estimated infant mortality in these areas. METHODS: Linked birth-infant death files for 1989-1991 were used to compare VLBW and neonatal mortality among AI/AN infants in counties with reservations with those in non-reservation counties. The VLBW rates for non-reservation counties were applied to the reservation risk distribution to calculate directly adjusted VLBW and neonatal mortality rates for reservation counties. This method assumes that greater registration in non-reservation counties yields a more accurate estimate of the relationship between risk factors and outcomes. RESULTS: Despite a higher prevalence in reservation counties of risk factors, the reported VLBW rate was 0.84\% in reservation and 1.17\% in non-reservation counties. The neonatal mortality rate was 5.4 per 1,000 in reservation counties and 6.0 in non-reservation counties. Direct adjustment yielded a VLBW rate of 1.28\% (95\% CI: 1.14-1.39) and a neonatal mortality rate of 6.7-9.8 per 1,000 in reservation counties. CONCLUSIONS: Reported neonatal mortality among AI/AN may understate the true rate due to underregistration of VLBW births. Direct adjustment may be useful in estimating infant mortality rates for populations with incomplete vital registration.},

By following subjects over time, temporal changes in an outcome of interest can be directly observed and studied. An important question concerns the existence of distinct trajectory patterns. One way to determine these distinct patterns is through cluster analysis, which seeks to separate objects (subjects, patients, observational units) into homogeneous groups. Many methods have been adapted for longitudinal data, but almost all of them fail to explicitly group trajectories according to distinct pattern shapes. To fulfill the need for clustering based explicitly on shape, we propose vertically shifting the data by subtracting the subject-specific mean directly removes the level prior to fitting a mixture modeling. This non-invertible transformation can result in singular covariance matrixes, which makes mixture model estimation difficult. Despite the challenges, this method outperforms existing clustering methods in a simulation study},

To investigate whether in utero exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and its metabolite, dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane (DDE), is associated with childhood physical growth, we took a novel statistical approach to analyze data from the CHAMACOS cohort study. To model heterogeneity in the growth patterns, we used a finite mixture model in combination with a data transformation to characterize body mass index (BMI) with four groups and estimated the association between exposure and group membership. In boys, higher maternal concentrations of DDT and DDE during pregnancy are associated with a BMI growth pattern that is stable until about age five followed by increased growth through age nine. In contrast, higher maternal DDT exposure during pregnancy is associated with a flat, relatively stable growth pattern in girls. This study suggests that in utero exposure to DDT and DDE may be associated with childhood BMI growth patterns, not just BMI level, and both the magnitude of exposure and sex may impact the relationship.},

  abstract = {Extensive epidemiologic studies have suggested that adult disease risk is associated with adverse environmental conditions early in development. Although the mechanisms behind these relationships are unclear, an involvement of epigenetic dysregulation has been hypothesized. Here we show that individuals who were prenatally exposed to famine during the Dutch Hunger Winter in 1944-45 had, 6 decades later, less DNA methylation of the imprinted IGF2 gene compared with their unexposed, same-sex siblings. The association was specific for periconceptional exposure, reinforcing that very early mammalian development is a crucial period for establishing and maintaining epigenetic marks. These data are the first to contribute empirical support for the hypothesis that early-life environmental conditions can cause epigenetic changes in humans that persist throughout life.},

The initial search for articles to include in the meta-analysis identified 18 studies with potentially meta-analytic variables. Of the studies originally retrieved, 13 failed to meet all of the inclusion criteria and were excluded from the meta-analysis. A total of 14 meta-analyses were performed comparing cocaine-exposed infants to nonexposed infants on NBAS cluster scales at birth and at 3-4 weeks of age. While the meta-analytic combination of studies produced a large enough sample size to drive statistical significance in a small majority of the tests of difference between the cocaine-exposed and nonexposed infants both at birth and soon after, the magnitude of all effects was small. The largest reliable differences appeared for the motor performance and abnormal reflexes clusters. Both also demonstrated a slight trend for increasing standard differences from birth to measures obtained at 3-4 weeks. The orientation and autonomic regulation clusters produced small, significant effects at both time periods, but the trend was for reduced effect sizes over time. All other effects appear truly negligible.},

Two hundred and three of 1,452 young adults surveyed (14\%) reported witnessing as children at least one incident of physical aggression between their parents. Both men and women who witnessed interparental physical conflict reported higher levels of current psychological distress than a comparison group of young adults who never observed physical aggression between their parents. This group difference remained even after controlling for parental divorce, parental SES, physical abuse of the child, parental alcoholism, and nonphysical discord witnessed between parents. Additional analyses found that the negative effect of witnessing interparental aggression was intensified when the aggression was serious enough to warrant some type of outside assistance for the victim and when the parent of the same-sex was seen being victimized. Although these findings provided support for the theory that witnessing interparental physical aggression is a traumatic experience that may have long-term psychological ramifications, we also found that a substantial proportion of the variance accounted for in adult adjustment by interparental physical conflict was mediated through decreased parental caring and warmth during childhood. Implications for these results, limitations of the present study, and directions for further research are discussed.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: There has been a rise in the prevalence of large newborns over a few decades in many parts of the world. There is ample evidence that fetal macrosomia is associated with increased risk of complications both for the mother and the newborn. In current obstetrics, the macrosomic fetus represents a frequent clinical challenge. Evidence is emerging that being born macrosomic is also associated with future health risks. OBJECTIVE: To provide a review of causes and risks, prevention, prediction and clinical management of suspected large fetus/fetal macrosomia, primarily aimed at clinical obstetricians. METHODS: Medline and EMBASE were searched between 1980 and 2007 by combining either 'fetal macrosomia' or 'large for gestational age' with other relevant terms. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews was searched for the term 'fetal macrosomia'. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Although the causes of high birthweight include both genetic and environmental factors, the rapid increase in the prevalence of large newborns has environmental causes. The evidence is extensive that maternal overweight and associated metabolic changes, including type 2 and gestational diabetes, play a central role. There is a paucity of studies of the effect of intervention before and/or during pregnancy on the risk of having an 'overweight newborn'. It appears rational, however, that preventive measures should primarily be implemented before pregnancy and should include guidance about nutrition and physical activity in order to reduce the prevalence of overweight. In pregnancy, limited weight gain, especially in obese women, seems to reduce the risk of macrosomia, as do good control of plasma glucose among those with diabetes. Prediction of fetal macrosomia remains an inaccurate task even with modern ultrasound equipment. There is little evidence that routine elective delivery (induction or caesarean section) for the mere reason of suspected macrosomia should be employed in a general population. Vaginal delivery of a macrosomic fetus requires considered attention by an experienced obstetrician and preparedness for operative delivery, shoulder dystocia and newborn asphyxia.},

In contrast, methods based on marginal structural models (MSMs) can provide consistent estimates of causal effects when unmeasured confounding and model misspecification are absent. MSMs are a new class of causal models whose parameters are estimated using a new class of estimators-inverse-probability-of-treatment weighted estimators. We use a marginal structural Cox proportional hazards model to estimate the joint effect of zidovudine (AZT) and prophylaxis therapy for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia on the survival of HIV-positive men in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study, an observational study of homosexual men. We obtained an estimated causal mortality rate (hazard) ratio of .67 (conservative 95\% confidence interval .46-.98) for AZT and of 1.14 (.79, 1.64) for prophylaxis therapy. These estimates will be consistent for the true causal rate ratios when the functional forms chosen for our models are correct and data have been obtained on all time-independent and time-dependent covariates that predict both subsequent treatment and mortality.},

We describe examples of selection bias in case-control studies (eg, inappropriate selection of controls) and cohort studies (eg, informative censoring).

This structure is shared by other biases (eg, adjustment for variables affected by prior exposure). A structural classification of bias distinguishes between biases resulting from conditioning on common effects ("selection bias") and those resulting from the existence of common causes of exposure and outcome ("confounding"). This classification also leads to a unified approach to adjust for selection bias.},

Observational studies had previously suggested reduced CHD risk in hormone users. METHODS:: Using data from the observational Nurses\^g\texteuro\texttrademark{} Health Study, we emulated the design and intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis of the randomized trial. The observational study was conceptualized as a sequence of \^g\texteuro{} trials,\^g\texteuro{} in which eligible women were classified as initiators or noninitiators of estrogen/progestin therapy. RESULTS:: The ITT hazard ratios (HRs) (95\% confidence intervals) of CHD for initiators versus noninitiators were 1.42 (0.92\^g\texteuro "2.20) for the first 2 years, and 0.96 (0.78\^g\texteuro "1.18) for the entire follow-up. The ITT HRs were 0.84 (0.61\^g\texteuro "1.14) in women within 10 years of menopause, and 1.12 (0.84\^g\texteuro "1.48) in the others (P value for interaction {$\leq$} 0.08). These ITT estimates are similar to those from the Women's Health Initiative. Because the ITT approach causes severe treatment misclassification, we also estimated adherence-adjusted effects by inverse probability weighting. The HRs were 1.61 (0.97\^g\texteuro "2.66) for the first 2 years, and 0.98 (0.66\^g\texteuro "1.49) for the entire follow-up. The HRs were 0.54 (0.19\^g\texteuro "1.51) in women within 10 years after menopause, and 1.20 (0.78\^g\texteuro "1.84) in others (P value for interaction {$\leq$} 0.01). We also present comparisons between these estimates and previously reported Nurses\^g\texteuro\texttrademark{} Health Study estimates. CONCLUSIONS:: Our findings suggest that the discrepancies between the Women's Health Initiative and Nurses\^g\texteuro\texttrademark{} Health Study ITT estimates could be largely explained by differences in the distribution of time since menopause and length of follow-up. \textcopyright{} 2008 by Lippincott Williams \& Wilkins.},

  abstract = {Ill-defined causal questions present serious problems for observational studies\textemdash problems that are largely unappreciated. This paper extends the usual counterfactual framework to consider causal questions about compound treatments for which there are many possible implementations (for example, "prevention of obesity"). We describe the causal effect of compound treatments and their identifiability conditions, with a special emphasis on the consistency condition. We then discuss the challenges of using the estimated effect of a compound treatment in one study population to inform decisions in the same population and in other populations. These challenges arise because the causal effect of compound treatments depends on the distribution of the versions of treatment in the population. Such causal effects can be unpredictable when the versions of treatment are unknown. We discuss how such issues of "transportability" are related to the consistency condition in causal inference. With more carefully framed questions, the results of epidemiologic studies can be of greater value to decision-makers.},

  abstract = {Background The intention-to-treat comparison is the primary, if not the only, analytic approach of many randomized clinical trials. Purpose To review the shortcomings of intention-to-treat analyses, and of 'as treated' and 'per protocol' analyses as commonly implemented, with an emphasis on problems that are especially relevant for comparative effectiveness research. Methods and Results In placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials, intention-to-treat analyses underestimate the treatment effect and are therefore nonconservative for both safety trials and noninferiority trials. In randomized clinical trials with an active comparator, intention-to-treat estimates can overestimate a treatment's effect in the presence of differential adherence. In either case, there is no guarantee that an intention-to-treat analysis estimates the clinical effectiveness of treatment. Inverse probability weighting, g-estimation, and instrumental variable estimation can reduce the bias introduced by nonadherence and loss to follow-up in 'as treated' and 'per protocol' analyses. Limitations These analyse require untestable assumptions, a dose-response model, and time-varying data on confounders and adherence. Conclusions We recommend that all randomized clinical trials with substantial lack of adherence or loss to follow-up are analyzed using different methods. These include an intention-to-treat analysis to estimate the effect of assigned treatment and 'as treated' and 'per protocol' analyses to estimate the effect of treatment after appropriate adjustment via inverse probability weighting or g-estimation. \textcopyright{} 2011 The Society for Clinical Trials.},

When the goal is to guide decisions among several strategies, causal analyses of observational data need to be evaluated with respect to how well they emulate a particular target trial. We outline a framework for comparative effectiveness research using big data that makes the target trial explicit.

  abstract = {When using observational data, quantifying the effect of treatment duration on survival outcomes is not straightforward because only people who live for a long time can receive treatment for a long time. This problem doesn't apply to randomised trials because people are classified based on the treatment duration they are assigned, rather than the treatment duration that they achieve. This approach accepts that dead people do not deviate from their assigned treatment strategy. By transferring this insight to the analysis of observational data, we can follow three steps to estimate the effect of treatment duration from observational data without the bias of naive comparisons between long term and short term users. The first step is cloning people to assign them to multiple treatment strategies. The second step is censoring clones when they deviate from their assigned treatment strategy. The third step is performing inverse probability weighting to adjust for the potential selection bias introduced by censoring. The procedure can be used to compare any treatment strategies that are sustained over time. Cloning, censoring, and weighting eliminates immortal time bias in the estimates of absolute and relative risk, which helps researchers focus their attention on other biases that may be present in observational analyses and are not so easily eliminated. \#\#\# Summary box},

Methods: This multilevel study used computerized clinical data. The study comprised 2892 adults with Crohn's disease (CD) and 5895 with ulcerative colitis (UC) who received care at 16 medical centers within an integrated care organization in Northern California between 1998 and 2005. Results: Time trends included (1) a shift in gastroenterology-related visits from the gastroenterology division to primary care; (2) increased use of IBD-related drugs, except for a 7\% decline in use of 5-aminosalicylate in CD and no change in steroid use for CD; (3) for the prevalence of prolonged steroid exposure (120 days of continuous use), a 36\% decline for CD with a 27\% increase for UC; (4) declines in the hospitalization rates of 33\% for CD and 29\% for UC; and (5) for the surgery rate, no significant change for CD with a 50\% decline for UC. Conclusions: Declines in prolonged steroid exposure and the hospitalization rate for CD and in the hospitalization and surgery rate for UC are encouraging; however, the increase in prolonged steroid exposure for UC merits concern and further investigation. The variability in care patterns observed in this study suggests lack of standardization of care and the opportunity to identify targets for quality improvement. These findings should stimulate research to quantify the effect of current trends in IBD management. \textcopyright{} 2009 AGA Institute.},

This paper examines demographic, sociocultural, and behavioral factors that are associated with, and may influence risk of, low prenatal weight gain among adult women with low and normal body mass indexes. Available data suggest that these factors include ethnicity, socioeconomic status, age, education, pregnancy intendedness or wantedness, prenatal advice, and psychosocial characteristics such as attitude toward weight gain, social support, depression, stress, anxiety, and self-efficacy. Potential theoretical models for these associations include biological, behavioral, and mixed pathways. The design of targeted intervention studies will depend on further identification and characterization of sociocultural and behavioral risk factors that, along with reproductive and nutritional characteristics, may predict which women are most likely to have inadequate prenatal weight gain.},

Two large phase III trials have reported results comparing these 2 forms of ADT administration. The National Cancer Institute of Canada (NCIC) PR-7 trial studied men with an increasing prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level and no evidence of metastatic disease after definitive or salvage radiation therapy and radical prostatectomy. The Southwest Oncology Group 9346 trial studied men with newly diagnosed hormone-sensitive metastatic disease. The primary end point in both trials was overall survival with a noninferiority design. The NCIC trial showed that the overall survival in men treated with intermittent ADT was not inferior to that of men treated with continuous ADT, but the SWOG trial was inconclusive regarding noninferiority. Certain domains of quality of life were better in the intermittent arms of both trials. If using ADT in the setting of biochemical relapse, intermittent ADT should be strongly considered over continuous ADT, except perhaps in patients with Gleason score of 8 or higher. In men with metastatic disease, continuous ADT remains the standard of care, because the SWOG trial did not establish noninferiority of intermittent ADT with respect to survival. However, for those with significant side effects from ADT, establishing the risk group, as determined by PSA value after 7 months of ADT or the presence of pain at diagnosis, may help guide the choice of intermittent versus continuous ADT in men with metastatic disease. \textcopyright{} JNCCN - Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network.},

  abstract = {CONTEXT: Adverse childhood experiences such as physical abuse and sexual abuse have been shown to be related to subsequent unintended pregnancies and infection with sexually transmitted diseases. However, the extent to which sexual risk behaviors in women are associated with exposure to adverse experiences during childhood is not well-understood. METHODS: A total of 5,060 female members of a managed care organization provided information about seven categories of adverse childhood experiences: having experienced emotional, physical or sexual abuse; or having had a battered mother or substance-abusing, mentally ill or criminal household members. Logistic regression was used to model the association between cumulative categories of up to seven adverse childhood experiences and such sexual risk behaviors as early onset of intercourse, 30 or more sexual partners and self-perception as being at risk for AIDS. RESULTS: Each category of adverse childhood experiences was associated with an increased risk of intercourse by age 15 (odds ratios, 1.6-2.6), with perceiving oneself as being at risk of AIDS (odds ratios, 1.5-2.6) and with having had 30 or more partners (odds ratios, 1.6-3.8). After adjustment for the effects of age at interview and race, women who experienced rising numbers of types of adverse childhood experiences were increasingly likely to see themselves as being at risk of AIDS: Those with one such experience had a slightly elevated likelihood (odds ratio, 1.2), while those with 4-5 or 6-7 such experiences had substantially elevated odds (odds ratios, 1.8 and 4.9, respectively). Similarly, the number of types of adverse experiences was tied to the likelihood of having had 30 or more sexual partners, rising from odds of 1.6 for those with one type of adverse experience and 1.9 for those with two to odds of 8.2 among those with 6-7. Finally, the chances that a woman first had sex by age 15 also rose progressively with increasing numbers of such experiences, from odds of 1.8 among those with one type of adverse childhood experience to 7.0 among those with 6-7. CONCLUSIONS: Among individuals with a history of adverse childhood experiences, risky sexual behavior may represent their attempts to achieve intimate interpersonal connections. Having grown up in families unable to provide needed protection, such individuals may be unprepared to protect themselves and may underestimate the risks they take in their attempts to achieve intimacy. If so, coping with such problems represents a serious public health challenge.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Both underweight and obese mothers have an increased risk for adverse  offspring outcomes. Few studies have examined the association between prepregnancy body mass index (BMI) and children's neurodevelopment. SUBJECTS: We  used data from the nationally representative Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Birth Cohort (ECLS-B; n=6850). Children were classified according to their  mother's prepregnancy BMI (kg m(-2)) status: underweight (BMI {$<$}18.5), normal weight (BMI 18.5-24.9), overweight (BMI 25.0-29.9), obese class I (BMI 30.0-34.9), and obese class II and III (BMI {$>$}/=35.0). Children's age-adjusted mental development index (MDI) and psychomotor development index (PDI) T-scores (mean 50, s.d. 10) were obtained using a validated shortened version of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development-II at approximately 2 years of age. While adjusting for sociodemographics, we estimated the average MDI and PDI scores or the risk of delayed ({$<$}-1 s.d. vs {$>$}1 s.d.) mental or motor development, relative to children of normal weight mothers. RESULTS: Compared with children of normal weight mothers, MDI scores were lower among children of mothers of all other prepregnancy BMI categories, with the greatest adjusted difference among children of class II and III obese mothers (-2.13 (95\% CI -3.32, -0.93)). The adjusted risk of delayed mental development was increased among children of underweight (risk ratio (RR) 1.36 (95\% CI 1.04, 1.78)) and class II and III obese (RR 1.38 (95\% CI 1.03, 1.84)) mothers. Children's PDI scores or motor delay did not differ by maternal prepregnancy BMI. CONCLUSION: In this nationally representative sample of 2-year-old US children, low and very-high maternal prepregnancy BMI were associated with increased risk of delayed mental development but not motor development.},

  abstract = {The aim of the present study was to clarify relationships among the distribution of birth month, maturation and body size in young soccer players. We therefore examined physical and maturational differences between selected players, who were considered to have higher potential to play soccer at a professional level as decided subjectively by coaches, and unselected players. Participants were 332 elite soccer players (mean age = 12.2 +/- 1.5 years; range = 9.1-15.0 years). Participants were divided into six categories (under = U10 to U15), depending on chronological age. Height, body mass skeletal age and maturation difference (skeletal age - chronological age) were compared among four groups (quarter = Q1 to Q4) depending on month of birth. Overall, the distribution of players across the four quarters was skewed such that numbers were greatest in Q1 and smallest in Q4. No significant differences in maturation difference were observed between birth quarters in any age category. On the other hand, except for the U14 age category, there were no significant differences in height between Q4 and Q1 players. However, the height of Q4 players was significantly smaller than those of Q1 in three (U11, U13 and U14, P {$<$} 0.01) of six categories when maturation difference was statistically controlled. Our results suggest a clear bias toward quarter of birth and this bias may depend to some extent on differences in individual skeletal age and body size. Individual biological maturation should thus be considered when selecting adolescent soccer players.},

Sample Selection Bias as a Specification Error. Econometrica 47 (1):153-161.] two stage procedure and is adaptable to cross section and unbalanced panel data. The approach identifies both a method of testing for selection effects and for consistent estimation if selection effects are shown to be statistically significant. The approach is illustrated with a meta regression of wetland ecosystem values. The application shows that selection is statistically and economically significant. Selection effects lead to baseline wetland values that are almost 4 times larger than values computed using the selection corrected parameters. Value adjustment factors for wetland services and methodological variables appear less prone to selection effects. The uncorrected value adjustment factors for wetland services and research methods are, on average, within 15\% of the selection corrected value adjustment factors. \textcopyright{} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Records-based studies often have limited covariate data, leading some researchers to collect survey data on a subset. Results for survey responders may be biased due to selective nonresponse and will be less precise due to the decreased responder sample size. We use data from a study of air pollution and birth outcomes to illustrate how a 2-phase analysis can yield less biased and more precise results. Methods: Our phase 1 group was a cohort of Los Angeles births from which we obtained a phase 2 group of survey responders. We compared estimates for the odds ratio (OR) between entire pregnancy carbon monoxide (CO) exposure and low birth weight in the first- and second-phase groups, adjusting only for variables available for both groups. Results: For CO exposure of 1 part per million or higher, the conventional adjusted ORs and 95\% confidence intervals for low birth weight were 1.15 (1.06-1.25) and 1.33 (1.06-1.68) for the phase 1 and 2 groups, suggesting a possible response bias and decreased precision in the latter estimate. We performed 2-phase analyses of the survey responders and found results similar to those for the cohort when we accounted for possible differential response by CO exposure. In our final analysis, we included both birth record and survey variables in a 2-phase model corrected for possible response bias. The results from weighted-, pseudo-, and maximumlikelihood were similar: 1.13 (1.03-1.25); 1.14 (1.01-1.29); and 1.10 (0.97-1.24), respectively. Conclusion: Our approach provides a means of checking for response bias and adjusting both point and interval estimates to account for differential response.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In health surveys, considerable effort and expense are invested to achieve a high response proportion and thereby to reduce selection bias. We investigated the interrelation of recruitment efforts and expense with potential nonresponse bias based on data from a large health survey. METHODS: In a population-based health survey, a stratified sample of 6640 residents of the Augsburg (Germany) region was selected, of whom 4261 attended the main study between October 1999 and April 2001. A short telephone interview yielded additional information on nearly half of the nonparticipants. All recruitment contacts were documented, and expenses were estimated on the basis of unit costs. Different recruitment strategies were modeled retrospectively. We compared their cost savings as well as their influence on the response proportion and on prevalence estimates. RESULTS: The distribution of total contacting cost per individual was highly skewed with 50\% of the total sum spent on 17\% of the sample. Late responders showed many similarities with nonresponders; both included a higher percentage of people with impaired health and with greater behavioral health risks. We were able to identify recruitment strategies that may save up to 25\% of the recruitment costs without significant shift in the parameter estimates. Data collected in the short nonresponder interview proved to be important to correct for possible nonresponse bias. CONCLUSIONS: In general, prolonged recruitment efforts lead to a larger and more representative sample but at increasing marginal costs. Specific cost-saving recruitment strategies that do not enhance response bias can be suggested. Interviews of nonresponders are also useful. \textcopyright{} 2006 Lippincott Williams \& Wilkins, Inc.},

  abstract = {Research has shown that alcohol abuse is a significant problem among American Indians. It has been suggested, however, that American Indians and whites interpret the behavioral pattern differently, which may reflect the distinct symbolic-moral universes of the two groups. Whites are said to stereotypically blame Indians for the alcohol problem, and they favor assimilation to ameliorate it. American Indians purportedly blame the historical incursions of whites for the problem and advocate cultural revitalization to solve it. However, systematic empirical documentation of the competing viewpoints is lacking. Here we compare the perceptions of twelve American Indian and twelve white officials responsible for controlling alcohol abuse and related problems on the Wind River Indian Reservation, Wyoming. Data were collected using in-depth, semistructured interviews. The findings show that the two groups tend to converge in their assessments of the extent of the alcohol abuse problem but clearly diverge in their attributions concerning both its causes and appropriate approaches to controlling it. The discourse of whites and American Indians thus reflects the existence of separate symbolic-moral universes. This investigation redirects attention from the traditional focus on the incidence and etiology of alcohol abuse among American Indians to the politics surrounding the definition and interpretation of the deviant behavior. It also highlights the significance of cultural competition to race relations theories grounded in political economy, which are commonly used to analyze Indian-white contact.

The current study examined discrepancies between mothers' and children's reports of child emotion regulation. This investigation examined patterns of discrepancies for key aspects of emotion regulation (i.e., inhibition and dysregulated expression) and for three emotions (anger, sadness, worry). A total of 61 mother-child dyads (mean children's age = 9.3 years) participated. As hypothesized, discrepancies for inhibition subscales were of a larger magnitude than those for dysregulated expression subscales. Furthermore, age was related to discrepancies in both anger subscales, parent reports of child externalizing symptoms were related to anger dysregulated expression discrepancies, and child reports of internalizing symptoms were related to sadness dysregulated expression discrepancies. Overall, the findings suggest that patterns of discrepant reports are not random but rather may provide meaningful and useful information about the nature of emotion regulation. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

As an example, she examined the common practice of adjusting for history of spontaneous abortion when estimating the effect of an exposure on the risk of spontaneous abortion. She showed algebraically that such an adjustment could substantially bias the results even though history of spontaneous abortion would meet some definitions of a confounder. Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) were introduced into epidemiology several years later as a tool with which to identify confounders. The authors now revisit Weinberg's paper using DAGs to represent scenarios that arise from her original assumptions. DAG theory is consistent with Weinberg's finding that adjusting for history of spontaneous abortion introduces bias in her original scenario. In the authors' examples, treating history of spontaneous abortion as a confounder introduces bias if it is a descendant of the exposure and is associated with the outcome conditional on exposure or is a child of a collider on a relevant undirected path. Thoughtful DAG analyses require clear research questions but are easily modified for examining different causal assumptions that may affect confounder assessment.},

  abstract = {Case-control studies of birth defects might be subject to selection bias when there is incomplete ascertainment of cases among pregnancies that are terminated after a prenatal diagnosis of the defect. We propose a simple method to estimate inverse probability of selection weights (IPSWs) for cases ascertained from both pregnancies that end in termination and those that do not end in termination using data directly available from the National Birth Defects Prevention Study and other published information. The IPSWs can then be used to adjust for selection bias analytically. We can also allow for uncertainty in the selection probabilities through probabilistic bias analysis. We provide an illustrative example using data from National Birth Defects Prevention Study (1997-2009) to examine the association between prepregnancy obesity (body mass index, measured as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared, of {$\geq$}30 vs. {$<$}30) and spina bifida. The unadjusted odds ratio for the association between prepregnancy obesity and spina bifida was 1.48 (95\% confidence interval: 1.26, 1.73), and the simple selection bias-adjusted odds ratio was 1.26 (95\% confidence interval: 1.04, 1.53). The probabilistic bias analysis resulted in a median adjusted odds ratio of 1.22 (95\% simulation interval: 0.97, 1.47). The proposed method provides a quantitative estimate of the IPSWs and the bias introduced by incomplete ascertainment of cases among terminated pregnancies conditional on a set of assumptions.},

Artificial censoring entails censoring participants when they meet a predefined study criterion, such as exposure to an intervention, failure to comply, or the occurrence of a competing outcome. Inverse probability-of-censoring weights use measured common predictors of the artificial censoring mechanism and the outcome of interest to determine what the survival experience of the artificially censored participants would be had they never been exposed to the intervention, complied with their treatment regimen, or not developed the competing outcome. Even if all common predictors are appropriately measured and taken into account, in the context of small sample size and strong selection bias, inverse probability-of-censoring weights could fail because of violations in assumptions necessary to correct selection bias. The authors used an example from the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study, 1984-2008, regarding estimation of long-term acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-free survival to demonstrate the impact of violations in necessary assumptions. Approaches to improve correction methods are discussed. \textcopyright{} The Author 2011.},

These three threats are bias due to confounders, selection, and measurement error. Confounding, selection, and measurement bias have typically been characterized as distinct types of biases. However, each of these biases can also be characterized as missing data problems that can be addressed with missing data solutions. Here we describe how the aforementioned systematic threats arise from missing data as well as review methods and their related assumptions for reducing each bias type. We also link the assumptions made by the reviewed methods to the missing completely at random (MCAR) and missing at random (MAR) assumptions made in the missing data framework that allow for valid inferences to be made based on the observed, incomplete data.},

Over the past 15 years, stratification-based techniques as well as methods such as inverse probability-of-censoring weighted estimation have been more prominently discussed and offered as a means to correct for selection bias. However, unlike correcting for confounding bias using inverse weighting, uptake of inverse probability-of-censoring weighted estimation as well as competing methods has been limited in the applied epidemiologic literature. To motivate greater use of inverse probability-of-censoring weighted estimation and competing methods, we use causal diagrams to describe the sources of selection bias in cohort studies employing a time-to-event framework when the quantity of interest is an absolute mea- sure (e.g., absolute risk, survival function) or relative effect measure (e.g., risk difference, risk ratio). We highlight that whether a given estimate obtained from standard methods is potentially subject to selection bias depends on the causal diagram and the measure. We first broadly describe inverse probability-of-censoring weighted estimation and then give a simple example to demonstrate in detail how inverse probability-of-censoring weighted estimation mitigates selection bias and describe challenges to estimation. We then modify complex, real-world data from the University of North Carolina Center for AIDS Research HIV clinical cohort study and estimate the absolute and relative change in the occurrence of death with and without inverse probability-of-censoring weighted correction using the modified University of North Carolina data. We provide SAS code to aid with implementation of inverse probability-of-censoring weighted techniques.},

Moreover, the analytic approaches most frequently employed in the epidemiologic literature to minimize selection bias are difficult to implement appropriately in racial disparities research. This difficulty stems from the fact that frequently employed analytic techniques require that common causes of survival and the outcome are accurately measured. Unfortunately, such common causes are often unmeasured or poorly measured in racial health disparities studies. In the absence of accurate measures of the aforementioned common causes, redefining the target population or changing the study design represents a useful approach for reducing the extent of survival-related selection bias. To help researchers recognize and minimize survival-related selection bias in racial health disparities studies, we illustrate the aforementioned selection bias and how redefining the target population or changing the study design can be useful.},

  abstract = {We develop an approach, based on multiple imputation, that estimates the marginal survival distribution in survival analysis using auxiliary variables to recover information for censored observations. To conduct the imputation, we use two working survival models to define a nearest neighbour imputing risk set. One model is for the event times and the other for the censoring times. Based on the imputing risk set, two non-parametric multiple imputation methods are considered: risk set imputation, and Kaplan-Meier imputation. For both methods a future event or censoring time is imputed for each censored observation. With a categorical auxiliary variable, we show that with a large number of imputes the estimates from the Kaplan-Meier imputation method correspond to the weighted Kaplan-Meier estimator. We also show that the Kaplan-Meier imputation method is robust to mis-specification of either one of the two working models. In a simulation study with time independent and time-dependent auxiliary variables, we compare the multiple imputation approaches with an inverse probability of censoring weighted method. We show that all approaches can reduce bias due to dependent censoring and improve the efficiency. We apply the approaches to AIDS clinical trial data comparing ZDV and placebo, in which CD4 count is the time-dependent auxiliary variable. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2005 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Intelligence quotient (IQ) was measured at 7 years of age by Wechsler Intelligence Scales.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nRESULTS: Maternal prepregnancy BMI displayed inverted U-shaped associations with child IQ after adjustment for maternal age, maternal education levels, maternal race, marital status, socioeconomic status, smoking during pregnancy, parity and study center. Women with BMI at around 20 kg/m2 appeared to have the highest offspring IQ scores. After controlling for familial factors in the siblings' sample, maternal obesity (BMI{$\geq$}30.0 kg/m2) was associated with lower Full-scale IQ (adjusted \ss =-2.0, 95\% confidence interval -3.5 to -0.5), and Verbal scale IQ (adjusted \ss =-2.5, 95\% confidence interval -4.0 to -1.0), using BMI of 18.5-24.9 kg/m2 as the reference category. Compared with children born to normal-weight women who gained 21-25 lb. during pregnancy, those born to obese women who gained more than 40 lb. had 6.5 points deficit in IQ after adjustment for potential confounders.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSIONS: Maternal prepregnancy obesity was associated with lower child IQ, and excessive weight gain accelerated the association.

Nothing is known, however, about this effect in developing economies. Many of the latter are characterised by tropical climates with a rainy season associated with lower food availability and a greater prevalence of infectious diseases. We therefore predict that an association between birth month and reproductive output, if it exists, should be related to the rainy season. To test this prediction, we analysed census data of Vietnam obtained from IPUMS-International (Vietnam 1999 Population and Housing Census). Based on 493,853 women born between 1950 and 1977 and thus aged 22 to 49 years, we found that the time series of mean offspring count per month of birth has a highly significant period of 12 months (power = 46.871, P {$<$} 0.00001). Our results further indicate that the 12-month periodic signal has a maximum in July and a minimum in January. Accordingly, the peak corresponds to birth during the rainy season, the low if the third pregnancy month concurs with the rainy season. The month of birth is therefore clearly associated with the later reproductive performance of Vietnamese women, strongly supporting the assumption that environmental and maternal conditions during early development exert long-term effects on reproductive functioning. Provided the rainy season adversely affects developmental processes due to inadequate food and/or high infection risk, the association reported here points to a critical period of reproductive development during early pregnancy.},

METHODS: The sample included 370 children (187 probands and 183 siblings) participating in a family genetic study of attention and aggressive behavior problems. Univariate and stepwise logistic regression analyses were used to derive models for predicting two diagnostic conditions: ADHD and ODD/CD. RESULTS: The Attention Problems syndrome significantly predicted ADHD, and ODD/CD was significantly predicted by the Aggressive Behavior syndrome. Both scales demonstrated good diagnostic accuracy, as assessed through receiver operating characteristics analyses. Cut-point analyses confirmed the utility of low T-scores, 55 on the respective syndromes, for efficiently discriminating cases from noncases. CONCLUSIONS: CBCL syndromes display good diagnostic efficiency for assessing common externalizing disorders in children.},

We report a descriptive study of the seasonality of prematurity, low birth weight, small for gestational age, neonatal deaths, and stillbirths in the plains of Nepal.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nMETHODS: Using data collected prospectively during a randomized controlled trial of neonatal skin and umbilical cord cleansing with chlorhexidine, we analyzed a cohort of 23,662 babies born between September 2002 and January 2006. Project workers collected data on birth outcomes at the infant's household. Supplemental data from other studies conducted at the same field site are presented to provide context. 95\% confidence intervals were constructed around monthly estimates to examine statistical significance of findings.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nRESULTS: Month of birth was associated with higher risk for adverse outcomes (neonatal mortality, low birthweight, preterm, and small for gestational age), even when controlling for maternal characteristics. Infants had 87\% (95\% CI: 27 - 176\%) increased risk of neonatal mortality when born in August, the high point, versus March, the low point.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSION: Seasonality of neonatal deaths, stillbirths, birth weight, gestational age, and small for gestational age were found in Nepal. Maternal factors, meteorological conditions, infectious diseases, and nutritional status may be associated with these adverse birth outcomes. Further research is needed to understand the causal mechanisms that explain the seasonality of adverse birth outcomes.},

To account for differences between populations, researchers may consider standardizing results to a target population. We discuss several different types of homogeneity conditions that are relevant for standardization: Homogeneity of effect measures, homogeneity of counterfactual outcome state transition parameters, and homogeneity of counterfactual distributions. Each of these conditions can be used to show that a particular standardization procedure will result in an unbiased estimate of the effect in the target population, given assumptions about the relevant scientific context. We compare and contrast the homogeneity conditions, in particular their implications for selection of covariates for standardization and their implications for how to compute the standardized causal effect in the target population. While some of the recently developed counterfactual approaches to generalizability rely upon homogeneity conditions that avoid many of the problems associated with traditional approaches, they often require adjustment for a large (and possibly unfeasible) set of covariates.},

  abstract = {AIM/DESIGN Many epidemiological studies published on the association between maternal cocaine/crack use and birth weight have either lacked precision or failed to control for major confounding, predominantly by tobacco smoking. Meta-analysis enables a single summary measure of effect to be calculated by combining data from any number of individual studies, thus enhancing statistical power. We undertook a number of meta-analyses using only studies that had adjusted for tobacco smoking to estimate more precisely the effect of maternal cocaine use on birth weight. FINDINGS A meta-analysis of five studies presenting data for 'any' prenatal cocaine exposure, adjusted for tobacco smoking but unadjusted for gestational age, produced a pooled relative risk estimate from a fixed effects analysis of 2.15 (95\% CI 1.75-2.64). However, there was substantial heterogeneity among studies (p {$<$} 0.001), and the relative risk from a random effects analysis was smaller (1.65) with a confidence interval that included unity (95\% CI 0.94-2.83). Addition of a further study adjusted for gestational age had minimal effect on the pooled estimate: the fixed effects relative risk was 2.14 (1.77-2.60) and the random effects estimate 1.77 (1.15-2.71). When data on more intense prenatal exposure were analysed, the fixed and random effects analysis produced the same pooled estimate of the relative risk of 4.42 (2.24-8.71), suggesting that more frequent cocaine exposure was associated with a higher relative risk for low birth weight. Data from studies on mean reduction in birth weight produced a pooled estimate of 112 g (95\% CI 62-161 g). CONCLUSIONS The current study suggests that maternal cocaine use causes low birth weight, and that the effect is greater with heavier use. However, despite the adjustment for tobacco and the adjustment by some studies for other confounders such as race, maternal age, gravidity and socio-economic status, it could be argued that other life-style factors not controlled for may account for the observed effects. While this argument is not supported by some other types of study, the issue of residual confounding can only be finally addressed by analytical studies which adequately control for important variables.},

The estimates were used to create a chart with the smoothed means, percentiles, and SDs of gestational weight gain for each week of pregnancy.Conclusion: This chart allows researchers to express total weight gain as an age-standardized z score, which can be used in epidemiologic analyses to study the association between pregnancy weight gain and adverse or physiologic pregnancy outcomes independent of gestational age.},

Using a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods, we first construct and empirically validate a gold- standard list of lexical features (along with their associated sentiment intensity measures) which are specifically attuned to sentiment in microblog-like contexts. We then combine these lexical features with consideration for five general rules that embody grammatical and syntactical conventions for expressing and emphasizing sentiment intensity. Inter- estingly, using our parsimonious rule-based model to assess the sentiment of tweets, we find that VADER outperforms individual human raters (F1 Classification Accuracy = 0.96 and 0.84, respectively), and generalizes more favorably across contexts than any of our benchmarks. 1.},

Data Sources: Forty-one studies identified in a systematical Pub Med and Excerpta Medica Database (EMBASE) search for articles published from January 1, 1996, to April 1, 2008. Study Selection: Studies written in English comparing children born after assisted conception with children born after natural conception assessing CP, ASD, and developmental delay, based on original data with a follow-up of 1 year or more. Main Exposures: In vitro fertilization (IVF) with or without intracytoplasmic sperm injection or ovulation induction with or without subsequent intrauterine insemination. Main Outcome Measures: Cerebral palsy, ASD, and developmental delay. Results: Nine CP studies showed that children born after IVF had an increased risk of CP associated with preterm delivery. In our meta-analysis including 19 462 children exposed to IVF, we estimated a crude odds ratio of 2.18 (95\% confidence interval, 1.71-2.77). Eight ASD studies and 30 studies on developmental delay showed inconsistent results. No studies assessed the risk of CP, ASD, or developmental delay in children born after ovulation induction exclusively. Conclusions: Methodological problems were revealed in the identified studies, and the gaps in our knowledge about the long-term outcomes of children born after assisted conception are considerable, including a lack of information on the long-term consequences of ovulation induction. Possible associations with ASD and developmental delay need assessment in larger studies. Studies on assisted conception and CP from countries outside of Scandinavia are needed, including detailed information on time to pregnancy, underlying cause of infertility, and type of IVF treatment. \textcopyright{} 2009 American Medical Association.

  abstract = {2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) has been suggested as a possible etiologic factor for endometriosis, a condition in which endometrium-like tissues are present outside the uterus. The prevailing view pertaining to the origin of endometriotic cells is that they are from eutopic endometrial cells which regurgitate through fallopian tubes. In order to get insight into the possible involvement of TCDD in the pathogenesis of endometriosis, we suspected that TCDD may act differently on the endometrium with or without endometriosis. To address this, we examined the presence of messenger RNAs of arylhydrocarbon receptor (AhR), AhR nuclear translocator (Arnt) and two dioxin-responsive genes, cytochrome P-450 1B1 (CYP1B1) and downstream of tyrosine kinases (p62(dok)), in the endometrium of women with or without endometriosis using semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. All the genes were expressed throughout the menstrual cycle. The expression level of p62(dok) was higher in the proliferative phase than in the secretory phase. In contrast, the expression levels of AhR, Arnt and CYP1B1 seemed to be constant during the cycle. In terms of the comparison between non-endometriosis and endometriosis group, the mRNA levels of AhR, Arnt, CYP1B1 and p62(dok) were essentially similar. Interestingly, AhR mRNA level was significantly lower in smokers than in non-smokers. Based on the regression analysis, significant linear and positive correlations were observed between AhR and Arnt mRNA levels, and between Arnt and p62(dok) mRNA levels. In summary, expression of AhR and dioxin-related genes in the endometrium did not differ in women with or without endometriosis.},

  abstract = {Background: Adolescence is a transitional time for identity formation and relationships with parents. While people born through assisted reproduction techniques (ART) appear to be well adjusted in childhood, it is unclear whether these findings carry into adolescence, and whether diverse ART have different psychological outcomes. This review summarizes what is known about the psychological adjustment and family relationships of the growing number of children born through ART who are reaching adolescence. Methods: The Pubmed, Web of Knowledge, PsycINFO and Scopus databases were searched systematically for peer reviewed papers focusing on adolescent psychological adjustment and parent-adolescent relationships in families created byART. Key search inclusion criteria included all papers published in English relating to adolescents aged between 11 and 18 years. Results: Seventeen publications with varied methodologies were identified by this review. Only papers relating to in vitro fertilization (IVF), egg donation and donor insemination were identified. Results were categorized according toARTthat used the parents'own gametes (IVF) and those that involved reproductive donation (egg donation, and donor insemination). Compared with naturally conceived adolescents and standardized normative samples, adolescents born through all ARTs seemed to be equally well adjusted, and to have positive parent-adolescent relationships. Some differences were however identified based on the type of ART used. In particular, the sex of the parent and child, along with age and process of disclosure of the adolescent's conception were identified as key mediators of parent-adolescent relationships in families created by donor insemination. Conclusions: The studies in this review indicate that children born through ART have positive parent-adolescent relationships and are well adjusted, with some slight differences based on different ART. The generalizability of findings may be limited by the general low level of disclosure to adolescents in some of the publications, the small sample sizes of studies in the field, along with the large age range that encompasses adolescence. Findings should also be interpreted in light of the fact that many publications focus on singleton births. Future studies should also focus on egg donation, surrogacy and embryo donation, as well as the disclosure processes, and adolescents born into non-traditional families (same-sex or single parents) or those born using different types of donor (anonymous, identity-release or known).},

  abstract = {Causal mediation analysis is routinely conducted by applied researchers in a variety of disciplines. The goal of such an analysis is to investigate alternative causal mechanisms by examining the roles of intermediate variables that lie in the causal paths between the treatment and outcome variables. In this paper we first prove that under a particular version of sequential ignorability assumption, the average causal mediation effect (ACME) is nonparametrically identified. We compare our identification assumption with those proposed in the literature. Some practical implications of our identification result are also discussed. In particular, the popular estimator based on the linear structural equation model (LSEM) can be interpreted as an ACME estimator once additional parametric assumptions are made. We show that these assumptions can easily be relaxed within and outside of the LSEM framework and propose simple nonparametric estimation strategies. Second, and perhaps most importantly, we propose a new sensitivity analysis that can be easily implemented by applied researchers within the LSEM framework. Like the existing identifying assumptions, the proposed sequential ignorability assumption may be too strong in many applied settings. Thus, sensitivity analysis is essential in order to examine the robustness of empirical findings to the possible existence of an unmeasured confounder. Finally, we apply the proposed methods to a randomized experiment from political psychology. We also make easy-to-use software available to implement the proposed methods.},

  abstract = {Traditionally in the social sciences, causal mediation analysis has been formulated, understood, and implemented within the framework of linear structural equation models. We argue and demonstrate that this is problematic for 3 reasons: the lack of a general definition of causal mediation effects independent of a particular statistical model, the inability to specify the key identification assumption, and the difficulty of extending the framework to nonlinear models. In this article, we propose an alternative approach that overcomes these limitations. Our approach is general because it offers the definition, identification, estimation, and sensitivity analysis of causal mediation effects without reference to any specific statistical model. Further, our approach explicitly links these 4 elements closely together within a single framework. As a result, the proposed framework can accommodate linear and nonlinear relationships, parametric and nonparametric models, continuous and discrete mediators, and various types of outcome variables. The general definition and identification result also allow us to develop sensitivity analysis in the context of commonly used models, which enables applied researchers to formally assess the robustness of their empirical conclusions to violations of the key assumption. We illustrate our approach by applying it to the Job Search Intervention Study. We also offer easy-to-use software that implements all our proposed methods. \textcopyright{} 2010 American Psychological Association.},

  abstract = {Summary. Experimentation is a powerful methodology that enables scientists to establish causal claims empirically. However, one important criticism is that experiments merely provide a black box view of causality and fail to identify causal mechanisms. Specifically, critics argue that, although experiments can identify average causal effects, they cannot explain the process through which such effects come about. If true, this represents a serious limitation of experimentation, especially for social and medical science research that strives to identify causal mechanisms. We consider several experimental designs that help to identify average natural indirect effects. Some of these designs require the perfect manipulation of an intermediate variable, whereas others can be used even when only imperfect manipulation is possible. We use recent social science experiments to illustrate the key ideas that underlie each of the designs proposed.},

Contagion represents one key causal mechanism of such spillover effects, where one's treatment affects the outcome of another individual indirectly by changing the treated unit's own outcome. Alternatively, the treatment of one individual can affect the outcome of another person through other mechanisms. We consider the identification and sensitivity analysis of contagion effects. We analyse a randomized placebo-controlled trial of the get out the vote campaign, in which canvassers were sent to randomly selected households with two registered voters but encouraged only one voter within each household to turn out in an upcoming election. To address the problem of non-compliance, the experiment includes a placebo arm, in which canvassers encourage voters to recycle. We show how to identify and estimate the average contagion and direct effects by decomposing the average spillover effect. Our analysis examines whether canvassing increases the turnout of a non-contacted voter by altering the vote intention of a contacted voter or through other mechanisms. To address the potential violation of key identification assumptions, we propose non-parametric and parametric sensitivity analyses. We find robust contagion effects among some households.},

Acknowledgment of limitations requires an interpretation of the meaning and influence of errors and validity problems on the published findings. An examination of the full-text files of the first 50 articles published in 2005 in the six most-cited research journals and in two recently launched leading open-access journals showed that only 67 articles (17\%) used at least one word denoting limitations in the context of the presented scientific work. Only four articles (1\%) used the word limitation in their abstract; none referred to limitations of the present work that materially affected conclusions. Only five articles had a separate section on limitations. Conversely, 243 articles (61\%) used words detected by the roots error, valid, bias, reproducib, or false and 289 articles (72\%) used words with the root importan. Among the 25 top-cited journals' instructions to the authors and editorial policies, only one encourages discussion of limitations; importance, novelty, and lack of error are typically encouraged. Limitations should be better covered and discussed in research articles. To facilitate this, journals should give better guidance and promote the discussion of limitations.

The contributors to the ASA statement also wrote 20 independent, accompanying commentaries focusing on different aspects and prioritizing different solutions.

ADT, however, may be associated with numerous side effects, including an increased therapy-related cardiovascular mortality. Objective: To discuss different clinical settings in which ADT is currently used and to critically weigh the benefits of ADT against its possible side effects. Evidence acquisition: A MEDLINE search was conducted to identify original articles and review articles addressing the efficacy and side effects of ADT for the treatment of PCa. Keywords consisted of prostate cancer, hormonal therapy, adverse effects, radical prostatectomy, and radiotherapy. The articles with the highest level of evidence for the various examined end points were identified with the consensus of all authors and were reviewed. Evidence synthesis: Even short-term use of ADT may lead to numerous side effects, such as osteoporosis, obesity, sarcopenia, lipid alterations, insulin resistance, and increased risk for diabetes and cardiovascular morbidity. Despite these side effects, ADT is commonly used in various clinical settings in which a clear effect on improved OS has not been shown. Conclusions: ADT is associated with an increased risk of multiple side effects that may reduce quality of life and/or OS. Consequently, these issues should be discussed in detail with patients and their families before initiation of ADT. ADT should be used with knowledge of its potential long-term side effects and with possible lifestyle interventions, especially in settings with the highest risk-benefit ratio, to alleviate comorbidities. \textcopyright{} 2008 European Association of Urology.},

We calculated the bias in the odds ratio caused by excluding prenatally diagnosed pregnancies when the exposure of interest is not correlated with the likelihood of terminating an affected pregnancy and when it is correlated with an increase or decrease in this likelihood. We assumed that control infants did not have birth defects. When the exposure is not associated with the likelihood of a pregnancy termination, studies excluding terminations suffer a loss of precision. When the exposure is associated with an increase or decrease in this likelihood, the odds ratios are biased toward or away from the null, respectively. The magnitude of the bias will vary according to characteristics of the study population such as the prevalence of the exposure and the frequency with which prenatal diagnosis and elective termination are used. Whenever possible, pregnancies terminated after prenatal diagnosis must be included in epidemiologic studies.},

  abstract = {Objective: The test-negative design has emerged in recent years as the preferred method for estimating influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) in observational studies. However, the methodologic basis of this design has not been formally developed. Methods: In this paper we develop the rationale and underlying assumptions of the test-negative study. Under the test-negative design for influenza VE, study subjects are all persons who seek care for an acute respiratory illness (ARI). All subjects are tested for influenza infection. Influenza VE is estimated from the ratio of the odds of vaccination among subjects testing positive for influenza to the odds of vaccination among subjects testing negative. Results: With the assumptions that (a) the distribution of non-influenza causes of ARI does not vary by influenza vaccination status, and (b) VE does not vary by health care-seeking behavior, the VE estimate from the sample can generalized to the full source population that gave rise to the study sample. Based on our derivation of this design, we show that test-negative studies of influenza VE can produce biased VE estimates if they include persons seeking care for ARI when influenza is not circulating or do not adjust for calendar time. Conclusions: The test-negative design is less susceptible to bias due to misclassification of infection and to confounding by health care-seeking behavior, relative to traditional case-control or cohort studies. The cost of the test-negative design is the additional, difficult-to-test assumptions that incidence of non-influenza respiratory infections is similar between vaccinated and unvaccinated groups within any stratum of care-seeking behavior, and that influenza VE does not vary across care-seeking strata. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {The effects of joint exposures (or exposure regimes) include those of adhering to assigned treatment versus placebo in a randomized controlled trial, duration of exposure in a cohort study, interactions between exposures, and direct effects of exposure, among others. Unlike the setting of a single point exposure (e.g., propensity score matching), there are few tools to describe confounding for joint exposures or how well a method resolves it. Investigators need tools that describe confounding in ways that are conceptually grounded and intuitive for those who read, review, and use applied research to guide policy. We revisit the implications of exchangeability conditions that hold in sequentially randomized trials, and the bias structure that motivates the use of g-methods, such as marginal structural models. From these, we develop covariate balance diagnostics for joint exposures that can (1) describe time-varying confounding, (2) assess whether covariates are predicted by prior exposures given their past, the indication for g-methods, and (3) describe residual confounding after inverse probability weighting. For each diagnostic, we present time-specific metrics that encompass a wide class of joint exposures, including regimes of multivariate time-varying exposures in censored data, with multivariate point exposures as a special case. We outline how to estimate these directly or with regression and how to average them over person-time. Using a simulated example, we show how these metrics can be presented graphically. This conceptually grounded framework can potentially aid the transparent design, analysis, and reporting of studies that examine joint exposures. We provide easy-to-use tools to implement it.},

It has not been clear when estimates from the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition can be interpreted causally because its implementation does not explicitly address potential confounding of target variables. While mediation analysis does explicitly adjust for confounders of target variables, it does so in a way that entails equalizing confounders across racial groups, which may not reflect the intended intervention. Revisiting prior analyses in the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth on disparities in wages, unemployment, incarceration, and overall health with test scores, taken as a proxy for educational attainment, as a target intervention, we propose and demonstrate a novel decomposition that controls for confounders of test scores (measures of childhood SES) while leaving their association with race intact. We compare this decomposition with others that use standardization (to equalize childhood SES alone), mediation analysis (to equalize test scores within levels of childhood SES), and one that equalizes both childhood SES and test scores. We also show how these decompositions, including our novel proposals, are equivalent to causal implementations of the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition.},

  abstract = {Causal decomposition analyses can contribute to the evidence base for interventions that address health inequities. Through study design and assumptions, they rule out alternate explanations such as confounding, selection-bias, and measurement error. However, their practical use is impeded by critical challenges. First, current approaches pay little attention to what variables a disparity measure itself should condition on or standardize over. Second, current approaches have ignored what hypothetical interventions should condition on and thus may not reflect equity concerns that actual interventionists would respect. Third, there are several estimators across the epidemiology and economics literature but their incorporation of equity value judgements has not been examined, and these do not cover many of the ways in which disparities and hypothetical interventions may be defined. In this paper, motivated by the clinical example of treatment intensification and hypertension control disparities, we address these issues of defining and estimating meaningful causal decompositions. We present a framework that explicitly considers what the disparity measure and hypothetical intervention account for and how these choices can be mapped to notions of equity. For these general estimands we provide identifying assumptions and estimators based on adaptations of ratio-of-mediator probability and inverse-odds-ratio weighting and evaluate their statistical performance.},

With selected populations or missing data, balance across treatment groups can be insufficient for estimating marginal treatment effects. Recently, a framework for using covariate balance to describe measured confounding and selection bias for time-varying and other multivariate exposures in the presence of right-censoring has been proposed. Here, we revisit this framework to consider balance across levels of right-censoring over time in more depth. Specifically, we develop measures of covariate balance that can describe what is known as ``dependent censoring'' in the literature, along with its associated selection bias, under multiple mechanisms for right censoring. Such measures are interesting because they substantively describe the evolution of dependent censoring mechanisms. Furthermore, we provide weighted versions that can depict how well such dependent censoring has been eliminated when inverse-probability-of-censoring weights are applied. These results provide a conceptually grounded way to inspect covariate balance across levels of right-censoring as a validity check. As a motivating example, we applied these measures to a study of hypothetical ``static'' and ``dynamic'' treatment protocols in a sequential multiple-assignment randomized trial of antipsychotics with high dropout rates.},

Bauer and Scheim, in a companion set of articles, extend these proposals by developing new attribution-blind measures of perceived discrimination and using VanderWeele's 3-way decomposition to quantify its contribution to disparities through differential exposure and differential effects (sometimes called differential vulnerability or susceptibility). In this commentary, after providing an overview of causal inference interpretations with social characteristics, we provide a broad overview of old and new decomposition methods in the social sciences literature and contrast their strengths and weaknesses for studying intersectional inequalities. We then examine how different forms of differential effects can be expressed within these decompositions and discuss their utility for the purpose of informing interventions for reducing disparities. Last, we discuss the tension in social sciences research when prominent explanatory variables represent constructs that are only defined or exist for certain marginalized populations and may not neatly fit within the decomposition methods framework. Through these discussions, we aim to provide greater conceptual clarity for applied researchers who are interested in using decomposition methods and other approaches to advance intersectional equity.},

Logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) independently for maternal smoking and maternal and infant gene variants, and to assess joint associations of maternal smoking and maternal or infant gene variants with gastroschisis. In analyses adjusted for maternal age at delivery and stratified by maternal race-ethnicity, we identified three suggestive associations among 30 potential associations with sufficient numbers to calculate ORs: CYP1A1*2A for non-Hispanic white mothers who smoked periconceptionally (aOR\,=\,0.38, 95\% CI 0.15-0.98), and NAT2*6 for Hispanic non-smoking mothers (aOR\,=\,2.17, 95\% CI 1.12-4.19) and their infants (aOR\,=\,2.11, 95\% CI 1.00-4.48).

To evaluate the effect of maternal age on waiting time to pregnancy, the authors reviewed hospital charts of all pregnant women attending prophylactic antenatal care at Odense University Hospital, Denmark, during 1972-1987. Only the first pregnancy of each woman and only planned pregnancies were included (n = 14,754). The fecundability odds ratio (FR) was calculated as the odds of a conception in a menstrual cycle among the older women divided by the odds among women aged 15-24 years. The FR for women aged 25-29 years was 1.12 (95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.04, 1.20), for women aged 30-34 years it was 1.15 (95\% CI: 1.01, 1.30), and for women above 34 years the FR was 2.44 (95\% CI: 1.84, 3.22) after adjustment for confounders. The increased fecundability with age is contrary to previous studies and may be explained by selection bias, as sterile women were not included. In addition, some very fertile young women who became pregnant by accident before efficient birth control methods were available and therefore were excluded from time to pregnancy studies may now use oral contraceptives until they plan a pregnancy later in life and are included.},

Arnt is also a dimerization partner of the hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha (HIF-1alpha) for the hypoxia signaling. Additionally, Arnt is found to be a potent coactivator of the estrogen receptor (ER) signaling. Thus we examined whether the presence of an increased amount of AhR may suppress both the HIF-1alpha and ER signaling pathways by sequestering Arnt. We tested our hypothesis using a human AhR construct C Delta553 which is capable of heterodimerizing with Arnt in the absence of a ligand. Transient transfection studies using a corresponding luciferase reporter plasmid in MCF-7 cells showed that C Delta553 effectively suppressed the AhR, HIF-1alpha, and ER signaling pathways. Reverse transcription/real-time QPCR data showed that C Delta553 blocked the up-regulation of the target genes controlled by AhR (CYP1A1), HIF-1alpha (VEGF, aldolase C, and LDH-A), and ER (GREB1, pS2, and c-myc) in MCF-7 cells. Since both HIF-1alpha and ER are highly active in the ER-positive breast cancer, C Delta553 has the potential to be developed as a protein drug to treat breast cancer by blocking these two signaling pathways.},

Participants were 6225 twin pairs from the Vietnam Era Twin Registry. Data were obtained on marital history, and if the individual was no longer married, how the marriage ended. Univariate analyses were performed to determine the extent of genetic and environmental influences each of the marital statues (i.e., marriage and divorce), followed by a novel bivariate analysis to test the shared variance between marriage and divorce. Results from this analysis revealed that the two different marital statuses were influenced by entirely distinct genetic and environmental factors. \textcopyright{} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

A traditional way of estimating indirect effects is to use the "difference method," which is based on regression analysis in which one adds a possible mediator to the regression model and examines whether the coefficient for the exposure changes. The difference method has been criticized for lacking a causal interpretation when it is used with logistic regression. In this article, we use the counterfactual framework to define the natural indirect effect (NIE) and assess the relationship between the NIE and the difference method. We show that under appropriate assumptions, the difference method consistently estimates the NIE for continuous outcomes and is always conservative for binary outcomes. Thus, the difference method can be used to provide evidence for the presence of mediation but not for the absence of mediation.},

When the exposure is subject to misclassification, the effects estimated can be severely biased. In this paper, when the mediator is binary, we first study the bias on traditional direct and indirect effect estimates in the presence of conditional non-differential misclassification of a binary exposure. We show that in the absence of interaction, the misclassification of the exposure will bias the direct effect towards the null but can bias the indirect effect in either direction. We then develop an EM algorithm approach to correcting for the misclassification, and conduct simulation studies to assess the performance of the correction approach. Finally, we apply the approach to National Center for Health Statistics birth certificate data to study the effect of smoking status on the preterm birth mediated through pre-eclampsia.},

Lykken (1992) found that divorce risk was, to a substantial degree, genetically mediated; prior research has identified numerous social and psychological factors that affect divorce risk (G. C. Kitson, K. B. Barbi, \& M. J. Roach, 1985). The present study attempted to link these domains by examining the extent to which genetic influences on one such psychological factor, per-sonality, explain divorce risk heritability. A sample of adult twins from the Minnesota Twin Registry completed a marital history questionnaire and the Multidimensional Personality Questionnaire (A. Tellegen, 1982). Positive Emotionality and Negative Emotionality factors were positively related to divorce risk, whereas Constraint was negatively related. In women and men, respectively, 30\% and 42\% of tlCe beritability of divorce risk consisted of genetic factors affecting personality and personal-ity and divorce risk correlated largely as a result of these common genetic influences. A substantial amount of research has been devoted to the study of divorce. Dozens of books and hundreds of scholarly articles have examined the cultural, sociological, and psycho-logical dynamics of this phenomenon. Recently, McGue and Lykken (1992) approached this topic from a different perspec-tive. Rather than attempting to describe the social circum-stances or personal attributes that contribute to the risk of di-vorce, they used a sample of twins to estimate the extent to which variation in divorce risk could be explained by the ge-netic factors contributed by one member of the marital union (i.e., the twin). Their findings were surprising: .53 \_+ .05 (+ SE)},

  abstract = {Background: Results of bias analyses for exposure misclassification are dependent on assumptions made during analysis. We describe how adjustment for misclassification is affected by incorrect assumptions about whether sensitivity and specificity are the same (nondifferential) or different (differential) for cases and noncases. Methods: We adjusted for exposure misclassification using probabilistic bias analysis, under correct and incorrect assumptions about whether exposure misclassification was differential or not. First, we used simulated data sets in which nondifferential and differential misclassification were introduced. Then, we used data on obesity and diabetes from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) in which both self-reported (misclassified) and measured (true) obesity were available, using literature estimates of sensitivity and specificity to adjust for bias. The ratio of odds ratio (ROR; observed odds ratio divided by true odds ratio) was used to quantify magnitude of bias, with ROR = 1 signifying no bias. Results: In the simulated data sets, under incorrect assumptions (eg, assuming nondifferential misclassification when it was truly differential), results were biased, with RORs ranging from 0.18 to 2.46. In NHANES, results adjusted based on incorrect assumptions also produced biased results, with RORs ranging from 1.26 to 1.55; results were more biased when making these adjustments than when using the misclassified exposure values (ROR = 0.91). Conclusions: Making an incorrect assumption about nondifferential or differential exposure misclassification in bias analyses can lead to more biased results than if no adjustment is performed. In our analyses, incorporating uncertainty using probabilistic bias analysis was not sufficient to overcome this problem.},

  abstract = {Much of the literature on the healthy worker effect focuses on studies of chronic disease and mortality; however, when studying pregnancy outcomes, these effects might differ because of the short, defined risk periods of most pregnancy outcomes. Three pregnancy-specific healthy worker effects have also been described, but the structure of these effects has not yet been investigated when occupational exposure, and not employment status, is the exposure of interest. We used directed acyclic graphs to examine healthy worker effects in studies of occupational exposures and pregnancy outcomes: the healthy hire effect, the healthy worker survivor effect, the desperation/privilege effect (differential workforce reentry after pregnancy), the reproductively unhealthy worker effect (women with live births leave the workforce, while women with nonlive births do not), and the insecure pregnancy effect (women with adverse pregnancy outcomes reduce their exposures in subsequent pregnancies). Given our assumptions, we conclude that the healthy hire effect, the desperation/privilege effect, the reproductively unhealthy worker effect, and the insecure pregnancy effect result from confounding that can be addressed if data on measured confounders, such as employment status, are available. The presence of the healthy worker survivor effect, however, varies by study design. Different types of healthy worker effects can be present in studies of occupational exposure and pregnancy outcomes, and many of them are easily addressed analytically.},

Less well understood are the mechanisms that account for neurodevelopmental disorders arising from maternal inflammation. This review seeks to begin an examination of possible sites and mechanisms of action whereby inflammatory cytokines - produced by the mother or by the fetal brain - could impact the developing fetus. We focus first on the placenta where cytokines maintain the immunological environment that prevents maternal rejection of the fetus. Following a brief examination of placental transfer of maternal cytokines, the focus turns on embryonic microglia, early and ubiquitous residents of the developing brain. Finally, a more intense examination of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) provides examples of glial- or maternal-derived cytokines that are known to have profound effects on developing systems and that could, if dysregulated, have undesirable consequences for brain development.},

These children showed a similar pattern of craniofacial, limb, and cardiovascular defects associated with prenatal-onset growth deficiency and developmental delay.  This is the 1st report to document an association between maternal alcoholism and aberrant morphogenesis in the offspring.  The mean duration of maternal alcoholism was 9.4 years.  3 of the cases were black, 3 were Native American, and 2 were white.  The mean gestational age was 38 weeks.  The degree of linear growth deficiency was more severe than the deficit of weight at birth, suggesting that a factor other than maternal undernutrition alone affected prenatal growth.  Developmental delay, prenatal and postnatal growth deficiency, and short palbebral fissures were observed in all 8 children.  7 of the 8 children also demonstrated microcephaly and maxillary hypoplasia with relative prognathism.  6 had an altered palmar crease pattern, 5 showed cardiac and joint anomalies, and 4 had epicanthal folds.  Although adequate nutrition was provided to the children during hospital admission and/or foster care placement, no catch-up growth was observed.  After 1 year, the average linear growth rate was 65\% of normal and the average rate of weight gain was only 38\% of normal.  By 1 year, head circumference fell below the 3rd percentile for height and chronological age in 5 of the 6 children in whom measurements were taken.  Fine motor dysfunction was present in 5 of the 6 children tested, and most were delayed in gross motor performance as well.  The similarity in pattern of malformation noted among these 8 children suggests a singular mode of etiology related to an as yet unknown effect of maternal alcoholism.  Direct ethanol toxicity is the most likely possibility.},

  abstract = {Gastroschisis is a congenital abdominal wall defect where there is herniation of abdominal organs. Optimal maternal nutritional intake, in particular, fatty acids, are vital for proper growth and development of the fetus. This pilot case\textendash control study explored the association of several biomarkers of fatty acids and gastroschisis. Between 2008 and 2011, we recruited 13 pregnant women in mid-gestation who were referred to the UCSD Prenatal Center for evaluation of an abnormal maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP) test and subsequently identified as carrying a baby with gastroschisis. Nine controls were selected from a false positive MSAFP or from the UCSD prenatal clinic. At enrollment, maternal blood was drawn for analysis of fatty acids. Mann\textendash Whitney\textendash Wilcoxon tests were used to test for mean differences between erythrocyte fatty acid biomarkers and the fatty acid lipogenic (palmitic acid: linoleic acid) and desaturation (palmitoleic acid: palmitic acid) indices and gastroschisis. Mothers carrying a baby with gastroschisis and gastroschisis babies had consistently higher levels of palmitoleic acid (all P's {$<$} 0.05), gastroschisis mothers had lower levels of oleic acid during pregnancy and at delivery, and higher levels of DHA at delivery (all P's {$<$} 0.05). The lipogenic index was significantly lower at delivery for gastroschisis mothers (P {$<$} 0.05) and the desaturation index was consistently higher in gastroschisis mothers and babies (all P's {$<$} 0.01). These findings suggest that early maternal inflammation possibly resulting from an imbalance of fatty acids, leading to a vascular disruption, may be the underlying mechanism responsible for at least some cases of gastroschisis. \textcopyright{} 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Subjects with hypertension or missing information on smoking, caffeine intake, or genotype were excluded. Subjects were genotyped by using polymerase chain reaction with mass spectrometry-based detection, and caffeine intake was assessed by using a validated food-frequency questionnaire.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nRESULTS: Compared with subjects who consumed {$<$}100 mg caffeine/d, subjects who consumed {$>$}400 mg caffeine/d were more likely to be carriers of the T, C, or T allele for rs6968865, rs4410790, and rs2472297, respectively. The corresponding ORs and 95\% CIs were 1.41 (1.03, 1.93), 1.41 (1.04, 1.92), and 1.55 (1.01, 2.36). Multivariate-adjusted ORs (95\% CIs) for rs6968865 were 1.44 (1.03, 2.00) for all subjects, 1.75 (1.16, 2.65) for nonsmokers, 1.15 (0.58, 2.30) for current smokers, 2.42 (1.45, 4.04) for subjects {$>$}57 y old, and 1.00 (0.65, 1.56) for subjects {$\leq$}57 y old.

Results from our study indicate that unwanted pregnancy is associated with prenatal and postpartum maternal behaviors that adversely affect infant and child health, but that unwanted pregnancy has little association with birth weight and child cognitive outcomes. Estimates of the association between unwanted pregnancy and maternal behaviors were greatly reduced after controls for unmeasured family background were included in the model.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effects of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on maternal, perinatal and neonatal outcomes by performing a systematic review of available published literature on pregnancies affected by COVID-19. METHODS We performed a systematic review to evaluate the effects of COVID-19 on pregnancy, perinatal and neonatal outcomes. We conducted a comprehensive literature search using PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure Database and Wan Fang Data until 20 April 2020 (studies were identified through PubMed alert after that date). For the research strategy, combinations of the following keywords and MeSH terms were used: SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, coronavirus disease 2019, pregnancy, gestation, maternal, mothers, vertical transmission, maternal-fetal transmission, intrauterine transmission, neonates, infant, delivery. Eligibility criteria included laboratory-confirmed and/or clinically diagnosed COVID-19, patient being pregnant on admission and availability of clinical characteristics, including at least one maternal, perinatal or neonatal outcome. Exclusion criteria were non-peer-reviewed or unpublished reports, unspecified date and location of the study, suspicion of duplicate reporting, and unreported maternal or perinatal outcomes. No language restrictions were applied. RESULTS We identified a high number of relevant case reports and case series, but only 24 studies, including a total of 324 pregnant women with COVID-19, met the eligibility criteria and were included in the systematic review. These comprised nine case series (eight consecutive) and 15 case reports. A total of 20 pregnant patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were included in the case reports. In the combined data from the eight consecutive case series, including 211 (71.5\%) cases of laboratory-confirmed and 84 (28.5\%) of clinically diagnosed COVID-19, the maternal age ranged from 20 to 44\,years and the gestational age on admission ranged from 5 to 41\,weeks. The most common symptoms at presentation were fever, cough, dyspnea/shortness of breath, fatigue and myalgia. The rate of severe pneumonia reported amongst the case series ranged from 0 to 14\%, with the majority of the cases requiring admission to the intensive care unit. Almost all cases from the case series had positive computer tomography chest findings. All six and 22 cases that had nucleic-acid testing in vaginal mucus and breast milk samples, respectively, were negative for SARS-CoV-2. Only four cases of spontaneous miscarriage or abortion were reported. In the consecutive case series, 219/295 women had delivered at the time of reporting, and the majority of these had Cesarean section. The gestational age at delivery ranged from 28 to 41\,weeks. Apgar scores at 1 and 5 min ranged from 7 to 10 and 7 to 10, respectively. Only eight neonates had birth weight {$<$}2500 g and nearly one-third of cases were transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit. There was one case each of neonatal asphyxia and neonatal death. In 155 neonates that had nucleic-acid testing in throat swab, all, except three cases, were negative for SARS-CoV-2. There were seven maternal deaths, four intrauterine fetal deaths (one with twin pregnancy) and two neonatal deaths (twin pregnancy) reported in a non-consecutive case series of nine cases with severe COVID-19. From the case reports, two maternal deaths, one neonatal death and two cases of neonatal SARS-CoV-2 infection were reported. CONCLUSIONS Despite the increasing number of published studies on COVID-19 in pregnancy, there are insufficient good-quality data to draw unbiased conclusions with regard to the severity of the disease or specific complications of COVID-19 in pregnant women, as well as vertical transmission, perinatal and neonatal complications. In order to answer specific questions in relation to the impact of COVID-19 on pregnant women and their fetuses through meaningful good-quality research, we urge researchers and investigators to present complete outcome data and reference previously published cases in their publications, and to record such reporting when the data of a case are entered into a registry or several registries.

  abstract = {Background: Recent studies in childhood cancer suggest that maternal vitamin supplementation may reduce the risk of leukaemia, neuroblastoma and certain types of childhood brain tumours. For example, a previous study found a significantly reduced risk of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) but not acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) in children with Down syndrome whose mothers reported any vitamin supplement use prior to knowledge of pregnancy (ALL OR adjusted for confounders 0.51, 95\% confidence limits (CL): 0.30, 0.89; AML OR adjusted for confounders 0.92, 95\% CL 0.48, 1.76). Recall of exposures, including maternal vitamin supplement use, however, may be difficult and subject to error. Epidemiologists are encouraged to quantitatively adjust for systematic error in study results, but often do not. Methods: The impact that misclassification of maternal vitamin supplement use may have had on the observed ORs in this study was quantified. Uncertainty analysis was used to calculate ORs adjusted for inaccurate reporting of vitamin supplement use under assumed probability distributions for exposure misclassification parameters. Results: Given our assumptions, adjustment for exposure misclassification yielded ORs that were predominantly more protective for ALL than the crude OR. Conclusions: Uncertainty analysis can give important insights into the magnitude and direction of error in study results due to exposure misclassification.},

Importantly, maternal environmental insults can adversely impact subsequent offspring behavior and have been linked with neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (AHDH). It is unknown if maternal obesity significantly alters offspring sociability, a key ASD feature, and if altering maternal diet will provide an efficacious intervention paradigm for behavioral deficits. Here we investigated the impact of maternal high fat diet (HFD) and maternal dietary intervention during lactation on offspring behavior and brain inflammation in mice. We found that maternal HFD increased anxiety and decreased sociability in female offspring. Additionally, female offspring from HFD-fed dams also exhibited increased brain IL-1{$\beta$} and TNF{$A$} and microglial activation. Importantly, maternal dietary intervention during lactation was sufficient to alleviate social deficits and brain inflammation. Maternal obesity during gestation alone was sufficient to increase hyperactivity in male offspring, a phenotype that was not ameliorated by dietary intervention. These data suggest that maternal HFD acts as a prenatal/perinatal insult that significantly impacts offspring behavior and inflammation and that dietary intervention during lactation may be an easily translatable, efficacious intervention to offset some of these manifestations.},

METHODS This observational study is based on annual reports from all IVF clinics in Sweden to the National Board of Health and Welfare for the time period 1991-2004. RESULTS The main finding is that despite a successive reduction in the number of embryos transferred, delivery rates were maintained at around 26\% while MBR decreased dramatically, from about 35\% to around 5\%. The same pattern was noticed, independent of age, for all women below 40. In comparison with the USA, lower delivery and MBR were noted for Sweden whereas a higher 'birth per embryo transferred' was found. CONCLUSIONS Single embryo transfer (SET) results in satisfactory delivery rates and a dramatic decrease in the MBRs, also when applied on a broad scale. The experience from Sweden ought to encourage other countries to introduce SET more widely.},

DV was assessed when children were at the age of five, emotional competence was assessed at the age of 9.5, and peer quality and behavioral adjustment were obtained at the age of 11. Children from homes with greater DV were less aware of their own emotions and more emotionally dysregulated at the age of 9.5. Emotional awareness mediated the relationship between DV at the age of five and children's friendship closeness and internalizing problems at the age of 11. Emotion dysregulation mediated the relationship between DV at the age of five and children's negative peer group interactions, social problems, and internalizing and externalizing problems at the age of 11. Results are discussed in terms of the impact of DV on children's emotional development and the role that different aspects of emotional competence play in children's socio-emotional adjustment.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Epidemiologic research is often devoted to etiologic investigation, and so techniques that may facilitate mechanistic inferences are attractive. Some of these techniques rely on rigid and/or unrealistic assumptions, making the biologic inferences tenuous. The methodology investigated here is effect decomposition: the contrast between effect measures estimated with and without adjustment for one or more variables hypothesized to lie on the pathway through which the exposure exerts its effect. This contrast is typically used to distinguish the exposure's indirect effect, through the specified intermediate variables, from its direct effect, transmitted via pathways that do not involve the specified intermediates. METHODS: We apply a causal framework based on latent potential response types to describe the limitations inherent in effect decomposition analysis. For simplicity, we assume three measured binary variables with monotonic effects and randomized exposure, and use difference contrasts as measures of causal effect. Previous authors showed that confounding between intermediate and the outcome threatens the validity of the decomposition strategy, even if exposure is randomized. We define exchangeability conditions for absence of confounding of causal effects of exposure and intermediate, and generate two example populations in which the no-confounding conditions are satisfied. In one population we impose an additional prohibition against unit-level interaction (synergism). We evaluate the performance of the decomposition strategy against true values of the causal effects, as defined by the proportions of latent potential response types in the two populations. RESULTS: We demonstrate that even when there is no confounding, partition of the total effect into direct and indirect effects is not reliably valid. Decomposition is valid only with the additional restriction that the population contain no units in which exposure and intermediate interact to cause the outcome. This restriction implies homogeneity of causal effects across strata of the intermediate. CONCLUSIONS: Reliable effect decomposition requires not only absence of confounding, but also absence of unit-level interaction and use of linear contrasts as measures of causal effect. Epidemiologists should be wary of etiologic inference based on adjusting for intermediates, especially when using ratio effect measures or when absence of interacting potential response types cannot be confidently asserted.},

  abstract = {Adjusting for a causal intermediate is a common analytic strategy for estimating an average causal direct effect (ACDE). The ACDE is the component of the total exposure effect that is not relayed through the specified intermediate. Even if the total effect is unconfounded, the usual ACDE estimate may be biased when an unmeasured variable affects the intermediate and outcome variables. Using linear programming optimization to compute non-parametric bounds, we develop new ACDE estimators for binary measured variables in this causal structure, and use root mean square confounding bias (RMSB) to compare their performance with the usual stratified estimator in simulated distributions of target populations comprised of the 64 possible potential response types as well as distributions of target populations restricted to subsets of 18 or 12 potential response types defined by monotonicity or no-interactions assumptions of unit-level causal effects. We also consider target population distributions conditioned on fixed outcome risk among the unexposed, or fixed true ACDE in one stratum of the intermediate. Results show that a midpoint estimator constructed from the optimization bounds has consistently lower RMSB than the usual stratified estimator both unconditionally and conditioned on any risk in the unexposed. When conditioning on true ACDE, this midpoint estimator performs more poorly only when conditioned on an extreme true ACDE in one stratum of the intermediate, yet outperforms the stratified estimator in the other stratum when interaction is permitted. An alternate 'limit-modified crude' estimator can never perform less favourably than the stratified estimator, and often has lower RMSB.},

  abstract = {American Indian adolescents have two to four times the rate of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) compared to whites nationally, they shoulder twice the proportion of AIDS compared to their national counterparts, and they have a 25\% higher level of teen births. Yet little is known about the contemporary expectations, pressures, and norms that influence American Indian youth or how those might be shaped by today's lived cultural experiences, which frustrates attempts to mitigate the apparent disparity in sexual health. This paper used data from focus groups, in-depth interviews, and surveys with American Indian adolescents and young male and female adults from a Northern Plains tribe to contextualize sexual risk (and avoidance). Placing the findings within an adapted indigenist stress-coping framework, we found that youth faced intense pressures for early sex, often associated with substance use. Condoms were not associated with stigma, yet few seemed to value their importance for disease prevention. Youth encountered few economic or social recriminations for a teen birth. As such, cultural influences are important to American Indian sexual health and could be a key part of prevention strategies. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Most epidemiology textbooks have the obligatory passage on `what is a cause?' These discussions often start with Hume, pass reverently through Bradford-Hill and (if the book is of relatively recent vintage) end with Pearl. But as Hafeman and Schwartz1 point out in their essay, few texts in our field go on to the question that really motivates these authors, which is `what is a causal structure?' The closest thing I can find on my own bookcase might be Mervyn Susser's2 `Causal Thinking in the Health Sciences', now more than 35 years old and long out of print.Despite the generally simplistic approach taken by our textbooks, the big breakthrough stories in biomedical research often sound like a sportscaster narrating the progress of a pinball machine game: `First the ball hits a lever, than bounces into a hole, where it triggers a sensor that opens a chute, and the ball slides down to the flipper \ldots '. The answer to a causal question such as `how did I just lose that ball down the side chute?' can only be answered by referring to (i) multiple events that happened in sequence, (ii) the imagining of alternate ways that the sequence could have occurred instead and (iii) by having the whole process situated in a context with regular and comprehensible laws (such as the physical layout of the pinball machine, or the physiology and environment of a living organism). We naturally tend to conceive of `explanations' as Rube Goldberg devices, where some exposure leads to a predictable cascade of events, and finally to the `outcome'\textemdash a cancer, or a death, or whatever. And we can easily imagine holding some intermediate gear still, which interrupts the natural flow of this device, and in this way we find that the outcome depended on that step. This is an analysis of mediation.},

  abstract = {Summary: Low front-end cost and rapid accrual make Web-based surveys and enrolment in studies attractive, but participants are often self-selected with little reference to a well-defined study base. Of course, high quality studies must be internally valid (validity of inferences for the sample at hand), but Web-based enrolment reactivates discussion of external validity (generalization of within-study inferences to a target population or context) in epidemiology and clinical trials. Survey research relies on a representative sample produced by a sampling frame, prespecified sampling process and weighting that maps results to an intended population. In contrast, recent analytical epidemiology has shifted the focus away from survey-type representativity to internal validity in the sample. Against this background, it is a good time for statisticians to take stock of our role and position regarding surveys, observational research in epidemiology and clinical studies. The central issue is whether conditional effects in the sample (the study population) may be transported to desired target populations. Success depends on compatibility of causal structures in study and target populations, and will require subject matter considerations in each concrete case. Statisticians, epidemiologists and survey researchers should work together to increase understanding of these challenges and to develop improved tools to handle them.},

Follow-up is also facilitated by the web-based approach. However, the consequent self-selection raises the question of the importance of representativity when attempting to generalize the results of a study beyond the context in which they were obtained, particularly under effect heterogeneity. Our review is divided into three main components: first, sample surveys or prevalence studies, assessing the frequency or prevalence of some attitude or disease condition in a population from its frequency in a sample from this population; second, generalization of the results from randomized trials to the population in which they were performed and to other populations; and third, generalization of results from observational studies.},

We present a simple approach to implement the parametric g-formula that is sufficiently general to allow easy adaptation to many settings of public health relevance.},

Results of a Bayesian mediation model revealed indirect effects such that after controlling for other variables in the model, fathers' hostility was associated with greater emotional reactivity, which in turn was associated with children's reports of worrying. The indirect effects of mothers' hostility, parents' interparental violence, and child age on children's reports of worrying via children's emotional reactivity were not statistically significant. Results suggest that fathers' hostility is associated with children's reports of worrying among children residing with a substance-abusing parent via associations with children's emotional reactivity to parental conflict.

  abstract = {The number of students and disciplines requiring basic instruction in epidemiologic methods is growing. As a field, we now have a lexicon of epidemiologic terminology and particular methods that have developed and become canonical through the historical development of the field. Yet, many of our basic concepts remain elusive to some students, particularly those not pursuing a career in epidemiology. Further, disagreement and redundancy across basic terms limit their utility in teaching epidemiology. Many approaches to teaching epidemiology generally start with labeling key concepts and then move on to explain them. We submit that an approach grounded not in labels but in foundational concepts may offer a useful adjunct to introductory epidemiology education. We propose 7 foundational steps in conducting an epidemiologic study and provide examples of how these steps can be operationalized, using simple graphics that articulate how populations are defined, samples are selected, and individuals are followed to count cases. A reorganization of introductory epidemiology around core first principles may be an effective way forward for educating the next generation of public health scientists.},

  abstract = {The prevalence of childhood obesity in the United States has tripled since the 1980s and is strongly linked to the early onset of several metabolic diseases. Recent studies indicate that lower cognitive function may be another complication of childhood obesity. This review considers the research to date on the role of obesity and nutrition on childhood cognition and brain health. Although a handful of studies point to a maladaptive relationship between obesity and aspects of cognitive control, remarkably little is known regarding the impact of fat mass on brain development and cognitive function. Further, missing from the literature is the role of nutrition in the obesity-cognition interaction. Nutrition may directly or indirectly influence cognitive performance via several pathways including provision of key substrates for optimal brain health, modulation of gut microbiota, and alterations in systemic energy balance. However, in the absence of malnutrition, the functional benefits of specific nutrient intake on particular cognitive domains are not well characterized. Here, we examine the literature linking childhood obesity and cognition while considering the effects of nutritional intake. Possible mechanisms for these relationships are discussed and suggestions are made for future study topics. Although childhood obesity prevalence rates in some developed countries have recently stabilized, significant disparities remain among groups based on sex and socioeconomic status. Given that the elevated prevalence of pediatric overweight and obesity may persist for the foreseeable future, it is crucial to develop a comprehensive understanding of the influence of obesity and nutrition on cognition and brain health in the pediatric population.},

This analysis was conducted to further define the associations between gastroschisis and parental Hispanic ethnicity and acculturation, and to determine whether such associations vary by maternal age. Methods: This study was based on data from mothers of 753 gastroschisis cases and 6,496 control infants in the National Birth Defects Prevention Study. The relationships between gastroschisis and both parental Hispanic ethnicity and acculturation, within maternal age strata ({$<$}20 versus {$\geq$}20 years at conception), were assessed using logistic regression and principal component analyses. Results: The risk of gastroschisis in offspring of women {$<$}20 years old was not significantly associated with parental Hispanic ethnicity or acculturation. Among mothers {$\geq$}20 years old, US-born non-Hispanic white parents had a lower risk of gastroschisis in offspring as compared to either US-born Hispanic (odds ratios [ORs] ranging from 0.55 to 0.60) or English-speaking Hispanic (ORs ranging from 0.58 to 0.65) parents. Further, compared with US born Hispanic women {$\geq$}20 years, the risk of gastroschisis was lower for Hispanic women who had lived in the US {$<$}5 years (OR=0.35, 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 0.17, 0.74) or who migrated to the US at {$\geq$}20 years (OR=0.47, 95\% CI: 0.25, 0.88). Conclusion: These results provide further evidence that gastroschisis risk is associated with ethnicity and some aspects of acculturation.

In this study, we investigated the expression of these transcriptional regulators in the female reproductive tract. AHR and ARNT mRNA transcripts were readily detected by a ribonuclease protection assay in all reproductive tissues examined. The expression of these factors in the endometrium and myometrium did not vary during the menstrual cycle, and was not different in pre- versus post-menopausal women. However, post-menopausal women on continuous hormone replacement therapy had greater expression of AHR but not of ARNT in the endometrium and myometrium when compared with women not taking hormones. Leiomyomas expressed significantly less AHR and ARNT mRNA compared with normal myometrium. The ovaries expressed both AHR and ARNT mRNA, and expression was unaffected by age. Endometriotic ovarian cysts expressed more AHR but not more ARNT mRNA compared with healthy ovarian tissue. However, there were no changes in the expression of AHR or ARNT mRNA in ovarian cancer. In conclusion, the female reproductive tract expresses mRNA for the transcription factors AHR and ARNT, and changes in their expression at select target sites in specific pathological conditions such as endometriosis and uterine leiomyomas suggest a potential role for these factors in the pathogenesis of these conditions.},

  abstract = {Etiologic inferences on human teratogens are usually derived from case-control studies conducted either at birth or in spontaneous abortion series. Because both teratogens and defects may be associated with an increased risk of prenatal mortality, the possibility exists that selection bias may affect etiologic inferences. The authors derive relations between the true odds ratio (OR) relating a teratogen and a defect at the time of the occurrence of the defect and the apparent odds ratios observed in spontaneous abortion series and at birth, as functions of prenatal mortality. Depending on the pattern of interaction between the teratogen and the defect in affecting the rate of prenatal mortality, selection bias may lead to overestimation or underestimation of the true odds ratio. With increasing multiplicative effects on prenatal mortality, changes in selection bias tend to increase the observed odds ratio in spontaneous abortion series but to decrease the observed odds ratio at birth. For a range of rates of prenatal mortality, weak associations between exposures and defects (OR = 0.3-3) may well be due to selection bias; conversely, weak teratogens (OR {$<$}3) may be missed in case-control studies of defects conducted at birth. Selection bias due to prenatal mortality must be considered in the interpretation of etiologic studies of birth defects.},

  abstract = {Case series of infants with certain birth defect patterns and putative teratogenic exposures should be interpreted with caution since the presence of birth defects and the exposure among the same infants could be entirely due to chance. In the absence of other epidemiologic data, the plausibility for a causal association is strengthened by 1) rarity of the defect pattern, 2) rarity of the exposure in the population, 3) small source population, 4) short time period for the study, and 5) biologic plausibility for the association. These concepts are illustrated using case reports of putative teratogenicity of cocaine and etretinate. In the presence of epidemiologic data, the concept of attributable fraction in exposed (AFE) can be used to evaluate the likelihood that the defect pattern among infants with a particular exposure is attributable to the exposure. This quantity is related to the strength of the epidemiologic association between the defect pattern and the exposure, as measured in terms of relative risk R (or odds ratio), and is equal to (R - 1)/R. Even for strong teratogens such as maternal diabetes and isotretinoin, where R is about 7, in more than 14\% (1-AFE) of exposed infants with birth defects, the pattern of defects is not attributable to the exposure. Furthermore, AFE can be used to 'correct' crude measures of sensitivity (the proportion of exposed malformed infants with a defect pattern attributable to the exposure) and positive predictive value (the proportion of malformed infants who have the exposure and have the defect pattern attributable to the exposure). These concepts can be useful adjuncts to the quantitative evaluation of patterns of birth defects associated with suspected human teratogens.},

Using logistic regression, we estimated the magnitude of the association between prepregnancy body mass index and GDM and calculated the percentages of GDM attributable to overweight and obesity overall and by race/ethnicity.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nRESULTS: The overall estimated GDM prevalence ranged from 5.4\% among White women to 11.9\% among Asian/Pacific Islander women. The adjusted percentages of GDM deliveries attributable to overweight and obesity were 17.8\% among Asians/Pacific Islander, 41.2\% among White, 44.2\% among Hispanic, 51.2\% among Black, and 57.8\% among American Indian women.

Par exemple, Mednick (1997) a examin\'e l'impact d'un important s\'eisme survenu en Chine sur le d\'eveloppement intellectuel et psychologique d'enfants \`a na\^itre. Vingt-trois ans plus tard, des diff\'erences significatives dans le fonctionnement intellectuel, la d\'epression et la taille de certaines r\'egions du cerveau ont \'et\'e constat\'ees chez ce groupe en comparaison aux enfants du groupe t\'emoin. Des \'ev\'enements de moindre envergure, tels un divorce ou la perte d'emploi durant la grossesse, peuvent \'egalement augmenter l'incidence des complications obst\'etricales et avoir un impact sur le fonctionnement neurologique du b\'eb\'e, son poids \`a la naissance et la circonf\'erence de sa t\^ete. Le d\'ec\`es du p\`ere ou l'exposition \`a un d\'esastre naturel durant la grossesse ont \'et\'e associ\'es \`a la d\'epression, \`a la schizophr\'enie et \`a la criminalit\'e \`a l'\^age adulte. Divers effets adverses reli\'es aux \'ev\'enements stressants ont aussi \'et\'e not\'es chez les primates. L'ensemble de ces \'etudes sugg\`erent que le second trimestre de la grossesse constitue une p\'eriode critique pendant laquelle les \'ev\'enements stressants peuvent affecter le d\'eveloppement du foetus. Des contraintes m\'ethodologiques nuisent actuellement \`a la recherche sur le stress pr\'enatal maternel. Les \'etudes sur des animaux offrent d'excellents contr\^oles des environnements pr\'enatal et postnatal. Cependant, les r\'esultats de ces \'etudes sont difficilement applicables \`a l'humain \`a cause de la pr\'esence chez ce dernier, de nombreux facteurs de risque ou de protection absents chez les animaux. De plus, on ne peut assigner les stresseurs de fa\c{c}on al\'eatoire, dans les \'etudes sur les effets des \'ev\'enements de vie pendant la grossesse humaine. En effet, les traits de personnalit\'e de la m\`ere peuvent \^etre transmis certes g\'en\'etiquement mais \'egalement au niveau du d\'eveloppement.

  abstract = {Background: An inverse association between maternal smoking and preeclampsia has been frequently observed in epidemiologic studies for several decades. In the May 2015 issue of this journal, Lisonkova and Joseph described a simulation study suggesting that bias from left truncation might explain the inverse association. The simulations were based on strong assumptions regarding the underlying mechanisms through which bias might occur. Methods: To examine the sensitivity of the previous authors' conclusions to these assumptions, we constructed a new Monte Carlo simulation using published estimates to frame our data-generating parameters. We estimated the association between smoking and preeclampsia across a range of scenarios that incorporated abnormal placentation and early pregnancy loss. Results: Our results confirmed that the previous authors' findings are highly dependent on assumptions regarding the strength of association between abnormal placentation and preeclampsia. Thus, the bias they described may be less pronounced than was suggested. Conclusions: Under empirically derived constraints of these critical assumptions, left truncation does not appear to fully explain the inverse association between smoking and preeclampsia. Furthermore, when considering processes in which left truncation may result from the exposure, it is important to precisely describe the target population and parameter of interest before assessing potential bias. We comment on the specification of a meaningful target population when assessing maternal smoking and preeclampsia as a public health issue. We describe considerations for defining a target population in studies of perinatal exposures when those exposures cause competing events (e.g., early pregnancy loss) for primary outcomes of interest.},

However, few studies, and none in the USA, have examined the associations between types of ART procedures and parental infertility diagnoses with autism among ART-conceived children.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nSTUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Population-based retrospective cohort study using linkages between National ART Surveillance System (NASS) data for 1996-2006, California Birth Certificate data for 1997-2006, and California Department of Developmental Services (DDS) Autism Caseload data for 1997-2011.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nPARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: All live born ART-conceived infants born in California in 1997-2006 (n = 42 383) with 5-year observation period were included in the study. We assessed the annual incidence of autism diagnosis documented in DDS, which includes information on the vast majority of persons with autism in California, and the association of autism diagnosis with ART treatment factors and infertility diagnoses.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nMAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Among ART-conceived singletons born in California between 1997 and 2006, the incidence of autism diagnosis remained at {$\sim$}0.8\% (P for trend 0.19) and was lower with parental diagnosis of unexplained infertility (adjusted hazard risk ratio [aHRR]; 95\% confidence interval: 0.38; 0.15-0.94) and higher when ICSI was used (aHRR 1.65; 1.08-2.52), when compared with cases without these patient and treatment characteristics. Among ART-conceived multiples, the incidence of autism diagnosis between 1997 and 2006 remained at {$\sim$}1.2\% (P for trend 0.93) and was lower with parental diagnosis of tubal factor infertility (aHRR 0.56; 0.35-0.90) and higher when ICSI was used (aHRR 1.71; 1.10-2.66).\textbackslash n\textbackslash nLIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Study limitations include imperfect data linkages, lack of data on embryo quality and possible underestimation of autism diagnosis cases. Limitations of the observational study design could affect the analysis by the possibility of residual confounders. Since information about ICSI use was missing for most frozen/thawed embryo transfer cycles, our findings of association of ICSI use and autism diagnosis can only be generalizable to fresh embryo transfer cycles.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nWIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Our study provides additional evidence of the association between some types of ART procedures with autism diagnosis. Additional research is required to explain the increased risk of autism diagnosis with ICSI use, as well as studies on the effectiveness and safety of ICSI.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nSTUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTERESTS: The study was partially supported by the National Institutes of Health. The authors have no competing interests that may be relevant to the study.},

There is compelling evidence that the placenta plays an integral role in the vertical transmission of viruses, such as cytomegalovirus and human immunodeficiency virus, from the mother to the fetus. Although the sequelae of congenital viral infection (i.e., fetal anomalies, intrauterine fetal death, and persistent postnatal infection) may he devastating, very little is known about the passage of viruses across the placenta and the pathologic consequences of placental viral infection. We postulate that the syncytiotrophoblast, which forms a continuous barrier between the maternal and fetal circulation, is relatively resistant to viral infection. In support of this hypothesis, we observed that the susceptibility of trophoblast cells to infection by adenovirus and herpes simplex virus and the expression of viral receptors were reduced as trophoblast cells terminally differentiated into syncytiotrophoblast. Conversely, we observed that undifferentiated, extravillous trophoblast cells, which are susceptible to adenovirus infection, underwent pathologic changes (i.e., apoptosis) when infected by adenovirus in the presence of decidual lymphocytes (which were used to simulate the maternal immune response to viral infection). Based on these findings, we speculate that viral infection of extravillous trophoblast cells may negatively impact the process of placental invasion and predispose the mother and fetus to adverse reproductive outcomes that result from placental dysfunction.},

First, exposure to an adverse environment during early life can influence the long-term behavior of the offspring. Second, regulation of the nervous system development and functioning appears to involve epigenetic mechanisms that require a continuous supply of methyl group donors in food. We hypothesized that a maternal diet during pregnancy deficient in methyl donors (MDD) may lead to altered behavior in offspring through permanent changes in hippocampal DNA methylation. We used a rat model of prenatal dietary MDD to test this hypothesis in female offspring as they aged. Prenatal MDD reduced birth weight, litter size, and newborn viability. Aged female offspring of MDD mothers showed increased anxiety and increased learning ability in comparison with control diet group offspring. To explore the role of MDD on epigenetic mechanisms in the brain of adult offspring, we studied expression and methylation of 4 selected genes coding for glucocorticoid receptor, hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 11 type 2, neuronatin, and reelin proteins in the hippocampus. No major group differences in methylation or expression of the studied genes were detected, except for a significant down-regulation of the reelin gene in the MDD female offspring. The prenatal MDD diet caused intrauterine growth restriction, associated with long-term effects on the behavior of the offspring. However, the observed behavioral differences between the MDD and control diet offspring cannot be explained by epigenetic regulation of the specific genes investigated in this study.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Since the first description of the foetal damage of alcohol in 1967, numerous studies have outlined different aspects of neurodevelopmental dysfunction, adversely affecting the lives of children worldwide. Although the cause of the syndrome is sorted out, the pathogenesis of brain damage is far from being clear. In contrast to children exhibiting the full facial dysmorphology, who are relatively easy to diagnose, in those presenting only with alcohol-related neurodevelopmental damage diagnosis is much more challenging due to poor specificity of the brain dysfunction. Hence, identifying the neurodevelopmental phenotype of foetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is a major challenge.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nRECENT FINDINGS: Recently, a behavioural phenotype of FASD has been described and validated using items from the Child Behaviour Checklist. This tool has high sensitivity and specificity in separating children with FASD from those with ADHD and from healthy controls. In parallel, a number of intervention studies show promise in improving the abilities of children and adolescents with the syndrome to cope with daily tasks and improve their quality of life.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nSUMMARY: The neurobehavioural screening test can facilitate screening for FASD and is an official screening tool in the FASD toolkit of the Public Health Agency of Canada. Promising new interventions may attenuate the long-term outcome of these children.},

The authors illustrate how the resulting misclassification of marital status can produce substantial bias in estimates of bereavement effects associated with widowhood. They use as their main source of data the Longitudinal Study of Aging (LSOA), 1984-1990, a national survey of persons aged 70 years and older. The estimates are based primarily on 3,192 respondents who were married and cohabiting with their spouses at the time of the baseline survey and who could be matched to their spouses' records. Comparisons of widowhood status derived from matched spouse records with reported marital status recorded in LSOA interviews demonstrate that reliance on interview information leads to substantial misclassification of marital status. Results from survival models indicate that estimates of marital status effects are sensitive to whether and how marital status is updated after baseline interviews. For example, updating marital status in hazard models from interview information alone indicates a protective effect of widowhood, whereas classifying widowhood on the basis of spouses' death records reveals a significant bereavement effect (relative mortality risks between 1.3 and 1.4).},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Research has demonstrated an association between low birth weight (LBW; {$<$}2500 g) and adverse intelligence quotient (IQ) outcomes in childhood and early adolescence. We systematically evaluated whether this association persists into late adolescence and early adulthood and also assessed the influence of age of IQ assessment on effect size.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nMETHODS: During Stage 1 (meta-analysis of data on adolescents/adults), we searched for relevant articles in PsychINFO, PubMed, Ovid, CINAHL, ProQuest and ERIC until February 2011 (no lower limit). Studies which assessed full-scale IQ among LBW individuals ({$<$}2500 g), aged 13 years and older, with a normal birth weight (NBW; {$\geq$}2500 g) comparison group were eligible. A random-effects meta-analysis provided a pooled estimate of the difference in IQ scores between LBW and NBW individuals. Publication bias was assessed using Rosenthal's classic fail-safe N and Duval and Tweedie's Trim and Fill. During Stage 2, we added data from the Kerr-Wilson et al. meta-analysis (which included data from children; in Meta-analysis of the association between preterm delivery and intelligence. Journal Public Health 2011;33:1-8) to our sample from Stage 1 and conducted a meta-regression to evaluate the effect of age of IQ assessment.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nRESULTS: Using a total of 15 studies in Stage 1, it was demonstrated that NBW individuals scored an average of 7.63 IQ points higher than LBW individuals, CI = 5.95-9.31. After adjusting for publication bias, NBW samples demonstrated an IQ of 4.98 points higher than LBW samples, CI = 3.20-6.77. Furthermore, age at IQ assessment was a significant moderator of the association between birth weight and IQ, in that the effect size decreased from childhood into young adulthood.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSIONS: Cognitive impairments associated with LBW persist into adolescence and early adulthood; however, the influence of LBW on IQ decreases from childhood to young adulthood. These conclusions must be interpreted with caution due to unmeasured variables and possible influence from publication bias.},

The research material includes retrospective data of the age of the occurrence of ontogenetic events such as birth (N = 487), menarche (N = 2016) and menopause (N = 3597). In order to study the time of occurrence of ontogenetic events and to indicate the impact of environmental factors the survival analysis was applied. First, the percentiles of functions established for studied events were calculated. Next, the Kaplan-Meier survival curves were derived. In the last step the influence of environmental factors was established and the comparison of groups determined based on the chosen factors was performed. The delivery time shows that 14\% of infants were born preterm. The risk of preterm delivery increases with the severity of factors disrupting pregnancy (from none to coexisting maternal and fetal risk factors) ( ; p {$<$} 0.001). In the case of menarche percentile positions indicate that the menarche occurs between the 12th and the 14th year of life as the period in which most girls exceed the puberty threshold. The Cox's proportional hazard model indicates that the time of menarche occurrence is significantly depended ( 41.602; p {$<$} 0.001) on the place of the mother's residence and number of children in the family (respectively p {$<$} 0.03 and p {$<$} 0.001). The time interval established for 50\% occurrence of this experience was designated between the 49th and the 52nd years of life. The time of menopause occurrence is significantly depended on both of considered factors: the educational level and smoking cigarettes ( , p {$<$} 0.001). Survival analysis is suitable for studies of the distribution in time of developmental events. It can be used to indicate the factors which significantly influence the course of development by modifying the duration of developmental stages.},

Unadjusted analyses and stratification were used to study associations and confounding variables. A multivariate logistic regression model was fitted to assess the independent association between smoking and outcome. Results: Maternal smoking was associated with hyperactivity even after adjustment for sex, family structure, socioeconomic status, maternal age, and maternal alcohol use (odds ratio 1.30; 1.08-1.58). The association was particularly notable among children of young mothers with low social standing. A positive dose-response relationship was seen between maternal smoking and hyperactivity. Conclusion: This study, the largest population-based prospective follow-up on fetal nicotine exposure and later behavioral disorders, confirms earlier descriptions of the link between maternal smoking during gestation and childhood hyperactivity. Discontinuation or decreased use of cigarettes during pregnancy might improve behavioral outcome of children.},

  abstract = {Context: The World Health Organization defines preterm birth as birth at less than 37 completed gestational weeks, but most studies have focused on very preterm infants (birth at {$<$}32 weeks) because of their high risk of mortality and serious morbidity. However, infants born at 32 through 36 weeks are more common and their public health impact has not been well studied. Objective: To assess the quantitative contribution of mild (birth at 34-36 gestational weeks) and moderate (birth at 32-33 gestational weeks) preterm birth to infant mortality. Design, Setting, and Participants: Population-based cohort study using linked singleton live birth-infant death cohort files for US birth cohorts for 1985 and 1995 and Canadian birth cohorts (excluding Ontario) for 1985-1987 and 1992-1994. Main Outcome Measures: Relative risks (RRs) and etiologic fractions (EFs) for over-all and cause-specific early neonatal (age 0-6 days), late neonatal (age 7-27 days), postneonatal (age 28-364 days), and total infant death among mild and moderate preterm births vs term births (at {$\geq$}37 gestational weeks). Results: Relative risks for infant death from all causes among singletons born at 32 through 33 gestational weeks were 6.6 (95\% confidence interval [Cl], 6.1-7.0) in the United States in 1995 and 15.2 (95\% Cl, 13.2-17.5) in Canada in 1992-1994; among singletons born at 34 through 36 gestational weeks, the RRs were 2.9 (95\% Cl, 2.8-3.0) and 4.5 (95\% Cl, 4.0-5.0), respectively. Corresponding EFs were 3.2\% and 4.8\%, respectively, at 32 through 33 gestational weeks and 6.3\% and 8.0\%, respectively, at 34 through 36 gestational weeks; the sum of the EFs for births at 32 through 33 and 34 through 36 gestational weeks exceeded those for births at 28 through 31 gestational weeks. Substantial RRs were observed overall for the neonatal (eg, for early neonatal deaths, 14.6 and 33.0 for US and Canadian infants, respectively, born at 32-33 gestational weeks; EFs, 3.6\% and and 6.2\% for US and Canadian infants, respectively) and postneonatal (RRs, 2.1-3.8 and 3.0-7.0 for US and Canadian infants, respectively, born at 32-36 gestational weeks; EFs, 2.7\%-5.8\% and 3.0\%-7.0\% for the same groups, respectively) periods and for death due to asphyxia, infection, sudden infant death syndrome, and external causes. Except for a reduction in the RR and EF for neonatal mortality due to infection, the patterns have changed little since 1985 in either country. Conclusions: Mild- and moderate-preterm birth infants are at high RR for death during infancy and are responsible for an important fraction of infant deaths.},

  abstract = {Approaches for analyzing the risks of adverse pregnancy outcomes have been the source of much debate and many publications. Much of the problem, in our view, is the conflation of time at risk with gestational age at birth (or birth weight, a proxy for gestational age). We consider the causal questions underlying such analyses with the help of a generic directed acyclic graph. We discuss competing risks and populations at risk in the context of appropriate numerators and denominators, respectively. We summarize 3 different approaches to quantifying risks with respect to gestational age, each of which addresses a distinct etiological or prognostic question (i.e., cumulative risk, prospective risk, or instantaneous risk (hazard)) and suggest the appropriate denominators for each. We show how the gestational age-specific risk of perinatal death (PND) can be decomposed as the product of the gestational age-specific risk of birth and the risk of PND conditional on birth at a given gestational age. Finally, we demonstrate how failure to consider the first of these 2 risks leads to selection bias. This selection bias creates the well-known crossover paradox, thus obviating the need to posit common causes of early birth and PND other than the study exposure.},

  abstract = {Studies have examined the association between birth weight and intelligence, with the understanding that these are both related to a family's socioeconomic status. In sibling studies, the association between family socioeconomic position and intelligence is strong. Several studies have reported a lower mean intelligence score for those with the highest birth weights. The present sibling design study was performed to examine the apparent lower intellectual performance of those with birth weights in the highest range. Confounders were birth order, family socioeconomic position, or shared but unidentified family factors., The study population included all Norwegian male singletons (N = 242,771) born at term between 1967 and 1976 and later conscripted into the military. After exclusions, the study population included 217,746 men. Siblings were identified using the mother's identity. Two subset populations were categorized; the sibling subset included 137,574 men (of 104,893 mothers) with at least 1 sibling, and the fraternal population included 62,906 men who had at least 1 brother born at term. Participants were examined between 1984 and 2003, when 98.3\% were aged 18 to 19 years. The intellectual performance test included 3 timed components: arithmetic, word similarities, and figures. These test results are highly correlated with IQ scores based on the Wechsler Abbreviated Scales of Intelligence. To aid interpretation, the stanine test scores were transformed to an IQ scale with a mean of 100 and an SD of 15. Birth weight was classified into 8 levels with less than 2000 g the lowest and 5000 g or greater the highest. Birth weights of 4500 g or greater were considered macrosomic. Covariates included birth, maternal, and paternal factors. Primary analyses examined the association between birth weight, particularly macrosomia, and intelligence using a birth weight of 4000 to 4499 g as the reference., The mean birth weight was 3595 +/- 490 g, and the mean IQ score was 101.7 +/- 13.7 in the total study population. Mean IQ scores increased steadily from the lowest birth weight, reaching a peak value at 4000 to 4499 g, and declining in the 2 highest weight categories. The crude [beta] coefficient for birth weights of 5000 g or greater was -1.2 (95\% confidence interval, -2.2 to -0.3) compared with the reference weight. In the total population, 7826 births (3.6\%) were macrosomic, and 6832 (4.9\%) of the 137,574 sibling subset had sibship macrosomia. Mean differences in IQ scores were much larger for parental education level and somewhat larger for birth order than for birth weight. Other covariates were more weakly associated with IQ score. Sibship macrosomia, parental education, and birth order confounded the exposure-outcome association, and macrosomic men with birth injury or asphyxia had low mean IQ scores. The differences seen leveled off for birth weights of 4500 g or greater in the multivariable analysis, because of the influence of birth order and parental education. Including participants with injury or asphyxia in the analysis did not substantially alter associations between birth weight and IQ score., The majority of the association between high birth weight and low IQ score was caused by confounding from shared family factors. Participants from families with a tendency to have macrosomic babies had, on average, lower IQ scores than did other participants; however, men with higher birth weights tended to have higher IQ scores. Future research should attempt to identify the shared family factors contributing to the association. The creation of large prospective birth cohorts with sibling designs and application of multilevel analysis is necessary., Copyright (C) 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.},

RESULTS:: During an average 16.7 years of follow-up, 2421 cases of diabetes were identified and 3750 deaths occurred. For overweight/obese versus normal-weight women, the HR of mortality was 1.42 (95\% CI = 1.32-1.53) in women without diabetes and 0.69 (0.40-1.18) in women with incident diabetes. As BMI increased, mortality among women without diabetes increased and that among women with diabetes decreased. CONCLUSIONS:: We found the obesity "paradox" among women with and without incident diabetes in the same population. Selection bias may be a simple explanation for this "paradox."

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Exposure to ambient air pollution is widespread and may be detrimental to human brain development and a potential risk factor for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). We conducted a systematic review of the human evidence on the relationship between ASD and exposure to all airborne pollutants, including particulate matter air pollutants and others (e.g. pesticides and metals). OBJECTIVE To answer the question: "is developmental exposure to air pollution associated with ASD?" METHODS We conducted a comprehensive search of the literature, identified relevant studies using inclusion/exclusion criteria pre-specified in our protocol (registered in PROSPERO, CRD \# 42015017890), evaluated the potential risk of bias for each included study and identified an appropriate subset of studies to combine in a meta-analysis. We then rated the overall quality and strength of the evidence collectively across all air pollutants. RESULTS Of 1,158 total references identified, 23 human studies met our inclusion criteria (17 case-control, 4 ecological, 2 cohort). Risk of bias was generally low across studies for most domains; study limitations were related to potential confounding and accuracy of exposure assessment methods. We rated the quality of the body of evidence across all air pollutants as "moderate." From our meta-analysis, we found statistically significant summary odds ratios (ORs) of 1.07 (95\% CI: 1.06, 1.08) per 10-{$\mu$}g/m3 increase in PM10 exposure (n = 6 studies) and 2.32 (95\% CI: 2.15, 2.51) per 10-{$\mu$}g/m3 increase in PM2.5 exposure (n = 3 studies). For pollutants not included in a meta-analysis, we collectively evaluated evidence from each study in rating the strength and quality of overall evidence considering factors such as inconsistency, imprecision, and evidence of dose-response. All included studies generally showed increased risk of ASD with increasing exposure to air pollution, although not consistently across all chemical components. CONCLUSION After considering strengths and limitations of the body of research, we concluded that there is "limited evidence of toxicity" for the association between early life exposure to air pollution as a whole and diagnosis of ASD. The strongest evidence was between prenatal exposure to particulate matter and ASD. However, the small number of studies in the meta-analysis and unexplained statistical heterogeneity across the individual study estimates means that the effect could be larger or smaller (including not significant) than these studies estimate. Our research supports the need for health protective public policy to reduce exposures to harmful airborne contaminants among pregnant women and children and suggests opportunities for optimizing future research.},

  abstract = {An important problem within both epidemiology and many social sciences is to break down the effect of a given treatment into different causal pathways and to quantify the importance of each pathway. Formal mediation analysis based on counterfactuals is a key tool when addressing this problem. During the last decade, the theoretical framework for mediation analysis has been greatly extended to enable the use of arbitrary statistical models for outcome and mediator. However, the researcher attempting to use these techniques in practice will often find implementation a daunting task, as it tends to require special statistical programming. In this paper, the authors introduce a simple procedure based on marginal structural models that directly parameterize the natural direct and indirect effects of interest. It tends to produce more parsimonious results than current techniques, greatly simplifies testing for the presence of a direct or an indirect effect, and has the advantage that it can be conducted in standard software. However, its simplicity comes at the price of relying on correct specification of models for the distribution of mediator (and exposure) and accepting some loss of precision compared with more complex methods. Web Appendixes 1 and 2, which are posted on the Journal's Web site (http://aje.oupjournals.org/), contain implementation examples in SAS software (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, North Carolina) and R language (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). \textcopyright{} 2012 The Author.},

They must be controlled by external adjustments. We confronted an analysis in which a variable predicted misclassification of the exposure and of a confounder. The same variable confounded the exposure-outcome relation. The analysis focused on the relation between less-than-definitive therapy and breast cancer mortality in the 5 years after diagnosis. Receipt of less-than-definitive prognostic evaluation predicted misclassification of definitive therapy (the exposure) and stage (a confounder). Prognostic evaluation also confounded the therapy-breast cancer mortality relation. We used a sensitivity analysis to separate the misclassification biases from the confounding bias. The relative hazard associated with less-than-definitive therapy in the original multivariable model equaled 1.75 (95\% confidence interval = 1.02-3.00). The median estimate in 2,500 repetitions of the sensitivity analysis was a relative hazard of 1.64, and 90\% of the estimates fell between 1.47 and 1.83. The sensitivity analysis suggests that less-than-definitive therapy confers an excess relative hazard of breast cancer mortality in the 5 years after diagnosis. The original analysis, which adjusted for confounding by prognostic evaluation but not its misclassification biases, overestimated the relative hazard.},

Sensitivity analysis can provide such an assessment. Methods: We describe a method to reconstruct epidemiologic data, accounting for biases, and to display the results of repeated reconstructions as an assessment of error. We illustrate with a study of the effect of less-than-definitive therapy on breast cancer mortality. Results: We developed SAS code to reconstruct the data that would have been observed had a set of systematic errors been absent, and to convey the results. After 4,000 reconstructions of the example data, we obtained a median estimate of relative hazard equal to 1.5 with a 95\% simulation interval of 0.8-2.8. The relative hazard obtained by conventional analysis equaled 2.0, with a 95\% confidence interval of 1.2-3.4. Conclusions: Our method of sensitivity analysis can be used to quantify the systematic error for an estimate of effect and to describe that error in figures, tables, or text. In the example, the sources of error biased the conventional relative hazard away from the null, and that error was not accurately communicated by the conventional confidence interval.

Primary breast cancer cases were 25-55 years old at diagnosis between 1988 and 2000 and had a record of the diagnosis in the Massachusetts Cancer Registry. We matched 3 controls to each case on maternal age, year of giving birth and birth facility. Information on terminations (induced and spontaneous) before the birth of record, the matched factors and potential confounders were collected from the birth certificate. After adjustment for the matched factors, age, parity and maternal and paternal education, the odds ratio associating any termination history with breast cancer risk equaled 0.91 (95\% CI = 0.79-1.05). The marginally protective adjusted odds ratio largely derived from a protective effect among women with parity equaled to 1 (OR for any termination = 0.68; 95\% CI = 0.45-1.03), suggesting a protective effect of terminated pregnancy among women with one live birth.},

Observational epidemiologic results usually include a point estimate, a measure of random error such as a frequentist confidence interval, and a qualitative discussion of study limitations. Without randomization of study subjects to exposure groups, inference from study results requires an educated guess about the strength of the systematic errors compared with the strength of the exposure effects. Although quantitative methods to make these educated guesses exist, the conventional approach is qualitative, which reduces the educated guessing to a problem of reasoning under uncertainty. In circumstances such as these, humans predictably reason poorly. Heuristics and resulting biases that simplify the judgmental tasks tend to underestimate the systematic error, underestimate the uncertainty, and focus the inference on the study's specific evidence while excluding countervailing external information. Common warnings to interpret results with trepidation are an ineffective solution. The methods that quantify systematic error and uncertainty challenge the analyst to specify the alternative explanations for associations that are otherwise too readily judged causal. \textcopyright{} 2007 Lippincott Williams \& Wilkins, Inc.},

  abstract = {Bias analysis serves multiple objectives in epidemiologic data analysis. The objectives most often emphasized are quantification of uncertainty due to systematic errors and reduction in overconfidence by specifying hypotheses that compete with the causal hypothesis. A third objective is the utility of bias analysis to identify strategies for new data collection that will be productive in evaluating the validity of an association. The authors illustrate the value of this objective using two examples. The first example examines the value of comprehensive CYP2D6 genotyping in a study of tamoxifen resistance. Tamoxifen is metabolized primarily by CYP2D6 to more active forms. More than thirty polymorphisms in the CYP2D6 gene reduce its function. We genotyped the most prevalent CYP2D6 polymorphism and found a null association between genotype and breast cancer recurrence in a Danish population. One possibility is that incomplete genotyping of the multiple functional polymorphisms introduced non-differential misclassification and biased the association toward the null. We used bias analysis to evaluate the plausibility of this explanation and to guide a decision about devoting study resources toward more comprehensive genotyping of other polymorphisms in the CYP2D6 gene. The second example examines the association between vitamin K antagonist (VKA) therapy and the incidence of 24 site-specific cancers, using heart valve replacement as an instrumental variable. Earlier studies suggested a protective association between VKA anticoagulants and the incidence of cancer. We observed a null-centered distribution of associations, which may be due to non-differential misclassification of VKA therapy by the instrument. We used bias analysis to evaluate whether this misclassification was likely to explain the null-centered distribution of associations and to guide decisions about conducting a more expensive validation study. In the first example, the bias analysis showed that new data collection would be required to resolve the uncertainty, whereas the second example showed that new data collection was unlikely to be a productive use of scarce study resources. \textcopyright{} 2012 De Gruyter.

  abstract = {Quantitative bias analysis serves several objectives in epidemiological research. First, it provides a quantitative estimate of the direction, magnitude and uncertainty arising from systematic errors. Second, the acts of identifying sources of systematic error, writing down models to quantify them, assigning values to the bias parameters and interpreting the results combat the human tendency towards overconfidence in research results, syntheses and critiques and the inferences that rest upon them. Finally, by suggesting aspects that dominate uncertainty in a particular research result or topic area, bias analysis can guide efficient allocation of sparse research resources. The fundamental methods of bias analyses have been known for decades, and there have been calls for more widespread use for nearly as long. There was a time when some believed that bias analyses were rarely undertaken because the methods were not widely known and because automated computing tools were not readily available to implement the methods. These shortcomings have been largely resolved. We must, therefore, contemplate other barriers to implementation. One possibility is that practitioners avoid the analyses because they lack confidence in the practice of bias analysis. The purpose of this paper is therefore to describe what we view as good practices for applying quantitative bias analysis to epidemiological data, directed towards those familiar with the methods. We focus on answering questions often posed to those of us who advocate incorporation of bias analysis methods into teaching and research. These include the following. When is bias analysis practical and productive? How does one select the biases that ought to be addressed? How does one select a method to model biases? How does one assign values to the parameters of a bias model? How does one present and interpret a bias analysis?.We hope that our guide to good practices for conducting and presenting bias analyses will encourage more widespread use of bias analysis to estimate the potential magnitude and direction of biases, as well as the uncertainty in estimates potentially influenced by the biases.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Epidemiologic data sets continue to grow larger. Probabilistic-bias analyses, which simulate hundreds of thousands of replications of the original data set, may challenge desktop computational resources. METHODS: We implemented a probabilistic-bias analysis to evaluate the direction, magnitude, and uncertainty of the bias arising from misclassification of prepregnancy body mass index when studying its association with early preterm birth in a cohort of 773,625 singleton births. We compared 3 bias analysis strategies: (1) using the full cohort, (2) using a case-cohort design, and (3) weighting records by their frequency in the full cohort. RESULTS: Underweight and overweight mothers were more likely to deliver early preterm. A validation substudy demonstrated misclassification of prepregnancy body mass index derived from birth certificates. Probabilistic-bias analyses suggested that the association between underweight and early preterm birth was overestimated by the conventional approach, whereas the associations between overweight categories and early preterm birth were underestimated. The 3 bias analyses yielded equivalent results and challenged our typical desktop computing environment. Analyses applied to the full cohort, case cohort, and weighted full cohort required 7.75 days and 4 terabytes, 15.8 hours and 287 gigabytes, and 8.5 hours and 202 gigabytes, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Large epidemiologic data sets often include variables that are imperfectly measured, often because data were collected for other purposes. Probabilistic-bias analysis allows quantification of errors but may be difficult in a desktop computing environment. Solutions that allow these analyses in this environment can be achieved without new hardware and within reasonable computational time frames.

Unless studying all-cause mortality, any study following up individuals is subject to having a competing risk should individuals die during time period that the study covers. While there are prior papers discussing the need for competing risk methods in epidemiologic research, we are not aware of any review that discusses issues of missing data in a competing risk setting. Recent Findings We provide an overview of causal inference in competing risks as potential outcomes are missing, provide some strategies in dealing with missing (or misclassified) event type, and missing covariate data in competing risks. The strategies presented are specifically focused on those that may easily be implemented in standard statistical packages. There is ongoing work in terms of causal analyses, dealing with missing event type information, and missing covariate values specific to competing risk analyses. Summary Competing events are common in epidemiologic research. While there has been a focus on why one should conduct a proper competing risk analysis, a perhaps unrecognized issue is in terms of missingness. Strategies exist to minimize the impact of missingness in analyses of competing risks.},

Although some new tools have emerged in recent years, such as guidance workbooks and citizen briefs and panels, challenges related to using available tools to support the use of policy-relevant syntheses of quasi-experimental evidence arise from such studies potentially being harder for policymakers and stakeholders to commission and understand.

Methods and Results - A total of 4286 women and 4252 men aged 60 to 79 years from 24 British towns were studied. Number of children was positively associated with body mass index and waist-hip ratio in both sexes. In women but not in men, number of children was inversely associated with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and was positively associated with triglycerides and diabetes. For both sexes, similar "J" shaped associations between number of children and CHD were observed, with the prevalence lowest among those with 2 children and increasing linearly with each additional child beyond 2. For those with at least 2 children, each additional child increased the age-adjusted odds of CHD by 30\% (odds ratio, 1.30; 95\% confidence interval, 1.17 to 1.44) for women and by 12\% for men (odds ratio, 1.12; 95\% confidence interval, 1.02 to 1.22). Adjustment for obesity and metabolic risk factors attenuated the associations between greater number of children and CHD in both sexes, although in women some association remained. Conclusions - Lifestyle risk factors associated with child-rearing lead to obesity and result in increased CHD in both sexes; biological responses of pregnancy may have additional adverse effects in women.},

  abstract = {The proportion of child deaths that occurs in the neonatal period (38\% in 2000) is increasing, and the Millennium Development Goal for child survival cannot be met without substantial reductions in neonatal mortality. Every year an estimated 4 million babies die in the first 4 weeks of life (the neonatal period). A similar number are stillborn, and 0.5 million mothers die from pregnancy-related causes. Three-quarters of neonatal deaths happen in the first week - the highest risk of death is on the first day of life. Almost all (99\%) neonatal deaths arise in low-income and middle-income countries, yet most epidemiological and other research focuses on the 1\% of deaths in rich countries. The highest numbers of neonatal deaths are in south-central Asian countries and the highest rates are generally in sub-Saharan Africa. The countries in these regions (with some exceptions) have made little progress in reducing such deaths in the past 10-15 years. Globally, the main direct causes of neonatal death are estimated to be preterm birth (28\%), severe infections (26\%), and asphyxia (23\%). Neonatal tetanus accounts for a smaller proportion of deaths (7\%), but is easily preventable. Low birthweight is an important indirect cause of death. Maternal complications in labour carry a high risk of neonatal death, and poverty is strongly associated with an increased risk. Preventing deaths in newborn babies has not been a focus of child survival or safe motherhood programmes. While we neglect these challenges, 450 newborn children die every hour, mainly from preventable causes, which is unconscionable in the 21st century.},

Of these, 7482 were eligible for analysis using logistic regression. RESULTS: Participants reported 6707 live births, and 775 (10\%) spontaneous abortions ({$<$}20 weeks). After adjusting for age, parity, shift work, and hours worked, antineoplastic drug exposure was associated with a 2-fold increased risk of spontaneous abortion, particularly with early spontaneous abortion before the 12th week, and 3.5-fold increased risk among nulliparous women. Exposure to sterilizing agents was associated with a 2-fold increased risk of late spontaneous abortion (12-20 weeks), but not with early spontaneous abortion. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that certain occupational exposures common to nurses are related to risks of spontaneous abortion.},

However, when an association remains, it is not always clear how this should be interpreted. It may be explained by a causal direct effect of the exposure on the disease, or the adjustment may have been distorted due to various reasons, such as error in the measured mediator or unknown confounding of association between the mediator and the outcome.In this paper, we study various situations where the conditional relationship between the exposure and the outcome is biased due to different types of measurement error in the mediator. For each of these situations, we quantify the effect on the association parameter. Such formulas can be used as tools for sensitivity analysis or to correct the association parameter for the bias due to measurement error. The performance of the bias formulas is studied by simulation and by applying them to data from a case-control study (Leiden Thrombophilia Study) on risk factors for venous thrombosis. In this study, the question was the extent to which the relationship between blood group and venous thrombosis might be mediated through coagulation factor VIII. We found that measurement error could have strongly biased the estimated direct effect of blood group on thrombosis. The formulas we propose can be a guide for researchers who find a residual association after adjusting for an intermediate variable and who wish to explore other possible explanations before concluding that there is a direct causal effect.},

It yields estimates of the direct effect of the exposure on the outcome and of the indirect effect through the intermediate variable. Both esti- mates can be biased if the relationship between the mediator and the outcome is confounded. In this article, we study the effect of unmeasured confounding on direct and indirect effect estimates for a continuous mediator and an outcome that may be either binary, count, or continuous. We formulate the effect of the confounder on the intermediate and on the outcome directly in regression mod- els, which makes the formulas intuitive to use by applied users. The formulas are derived under the assumption that the confounder follows a normal distribution. In simulations, the formulas for a lin- ear response model performed well, also as it did when the unmea- sured confounder was binary. For a rare binary outcome, the formulas for logistic regression performed well if the unmeasured confounder followed a normal distribution, but for a binary confounder the bias in the direct effect was overcorrected. We applied the formulas to data from a case\textendash control study (Leiden Thrombophilia Study) on risk factors for venous thrombosis. This showed that unmeasured con- founding can severely bias the estimates of direct and indirect effects.},

This article reviews, elaborates and compares several approaches for analyzing nonlinear models with interaction and/or quadratic effects. A total of four approaches arc examined, including the product indicator ML approaches proposed by Jaccard and Wan (1995) and Joreskog and Yang (1996), a Bayesian approach and an exact ML approach. The empirical performances of these approaches are assessed using simulation studies in terms of their capabilities in producing reliable parameter and standard error estimates. It is found that whilst the Bayesian and the exact ML approaches produce satisfactory results in all the settings under consideration, and are in general very reliable; the product indicator ML approaches only produce reasonable results in Simple models with large sample sizes.},

Stop-signal inhibition improved at a rate similar to the age-related changes in Verbal IQ. Components of variance analyses revealed that stop-signal reaction time predicted a larger proportion of the age-related variance in children's verbal intelligence than non-age-related variance.

We sought to investigate the influence of pregravid obesity and fetal sex on placental histopathology while controlling for diabetes and hypertension. METHODS: Placental histopathology focusing on inflammatory markers of a cohort of normal weight (BMI = 20-24.9) and obese (BMI {$\geq$} 30) patients was characterized. Demographic, obstetric and neonatal variables were assessed. RESULTS: 192 normal and 231 obese women were included. Placental characteristics associated with obesity and fetal sex independent of diabetes and hypertension were placental disc weight {$>$}90(th) percentile, decreased placental efficiency, chronic villitis (CV), fetal thrombosis, and normoblastemia. Additionally, female fetuses of obese mothers had higher rates of CV and fetal thrombosis. Increasing BMI increased the risk of normoblastemia and CV. The final grade and extent of CV was significantly associated with obesity and BMI, but not fetal gender. Finally, CV was less common in large-for-gestation placentas. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal obesity results in placental overgrowth and fetal hypoxia as manifested by normoblastemia; it is also associated with an increased incidence of CV and fetal thrombosis, both more prevalent in female placentas. We have shown for the first time that the effect of maternal obesity on placental inflammation is independent of diabetes and hypertension, but significantly affected by fetal sex. Our data also point to the intriguing possibility that CV serves to normalize placental size, and potentially fetal growth, in the setting of maternal obesity.},

When the study sample is not a random sample of the target population, the sample average treatment effect, even if internally valid, cannot usually be expected to equal the average treatment effect in the target population. The utility of an effect estimate for planning purposes and decision making will depend on the degree of departure from the true causal effect in the target population due to problems with both internal and external validity. Herein, we review concepts from recent literature on generalizability, one facet of external validity, using the potential outcomes framework. Identification conditions sufficient for external validity closely parallel identification conditions for internal validity, namely: conditional exchangeability; positivity; the same distributions of the versions of treatment; no interference; and no measurement error. We also require correct model specification. Under these conditions, we discuss how a version of direct standardization (the g-formula, adjustment formula, or transport formula) or inverse probability weighting can be used to generalize a causal effect from a study sample to a well-defined target population, and demonstrate their application in an illustrative example.},

We demonstrate, using simulation and an example, that when the event of interest is captured outside of a study encounter (e.g., in a registry), person-time should be censored when the study-defined criterion for loss to follow-up is met (e.g., 1 year after last encounter), rather than at the last study encounter. Conversely, when the event of interest must be measured within the context of a study encounter (e.g., a biomarker value), person-time should be censored at the last study encounter. An inappropriate censoring scheme has the potential to result in substantial bias that may not be easily corrected.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In time-to-event analyses, there is limited guidance on when persons who are lost to follow-up (LTFU) should be censored. METHODS: We simulated bias in risk estimates for: (1) a composite event of measured (outcome only observable in a patient encounter) and captured events (outcome observable outside a patient encounter); and a (2) measured or (3) captured event in the presence of a competing event of the other type, under three censoring strategies: (i) censor at the last study encounter; (ii) censor when LTFU definition is met; and (iii) a new, hybrid censoring strategy. We demonstrate the real-world impact of this decision by estimating: (1) time to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) diagnosis or death, (2) time to initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART), and (3) time to death before ART initiation among adults engaged in HIV care. RESULTS: For (1) our hybrid censoring strategy was least biased. In our example, 5-year risk of AIDS or death was overestimated using last-encounter censoring (25\%) and under-estimated using LTFU-definition censoring (21\%), compared with results from our hybrid approach (24\%). Last-encounter censoring was least biased for (2). When estimating 5-year risk of ART initiation, LTFU-definition censoring underestimated risk (80\% vs. 85\% using last-encounter censoring). LTFU-definition censoring was least biased for (3). When estimating 5-year risk of death before ART initiation, last-encounter censoring overestimated risk (5.2\% vs. 4.7\% using LTFU-definition censoring). CONCLUSIONS: The least biased censoring strategy for time-to-event analyses in the presence of LTFU depends on the event and estimand of interest.},

  abstract = {Test-negative designs are commonplace in assessments of influenza vaccination effectiveness, estimating this value from the exposure odds ratio of vaccination among individuals treated for acute respiratory illness who test positive for influenza virus infection. This approach is widely believed to recover the vaccine direct effect by correcting for differential health-care-seeking behavior among vaccinated and unvaccinated persons. However, the relationship of the measured odds ratio to true vaccine effectiveness is poorly understood. We derived the odds ratio under circumstances of real-world test-negative studies. The odds ratio recovers the vaccine direct effect when 2 conditions are met: 1) Individuals' vaccination decisions are uncorrelated with exposure or susceptibility to the test-positive or test-negative conditions, and 2) vaccination confers ``all-or-nothing'' protection (whereby certain individuals have no protection while others are perfectly protected). Biased effect-size estimates arise if either condition is unmet. Such bias might suggest misleading associations of vaccine effectiveness with time since vaccination or the force of infection of influenza. The test-negative design could also fail to correct for differential health-care-seeking behavior among vaccinated and unvaccinated persons without stringent criteria for enrollment and testing. Our findings demonstrate a need to reassess how data from test-negative studies can inform policy decisions.},

  abstract = {Purpose of Review Pharmacoepidemiologists are often interested in estimating the effects of dynamic treatment strategies, where treatments are modified based on patients' evolving characteristics. For such problems, appropriate control of both baseline and time-varying confounders is critical. Conventional methods that control confounding by including time-varying treatments and confounders in an outcome regression model may not have a causal interpretation, even when all baseline and time-varying confounders are measured. This problem occurs when time-varying confounders are, themselves, affected by past treatment. We review alternative analytic approaches that can produce valid inferences in the presence of such confounding. We focus on the parametric g-formula and inverse probability weighting of marginal structural models, two examples of Robins' g-methods. Recent Findings Unlike standard outcome regression methods, the parametric g-formula and inverse probability weighting of marginal structural models can estimate the effects of dynamic treatment strategies and appropriately control for measured time-varying confounders affected by prior treatment. Few applications of g-methods exist in the pharmacoepidemiology literature, primarily due to the common use of administrative claims data, which typically lack detailed measurements of time-varying information, and the limited availability of or familiarity with tools to help perform the relatively complex analysis. These barriers may be overcome with the increasing availability of data sources containing more detailed time-varying information and more accessible learning tools and software. Summary With appropriate data and study design, g-methods can improve our ability to make causal inferences on dynamic treatment strategies from observational data in pharma coepidemiology.},

We show that the resultant estimator is asymptotically normal with a simple variance estimator. One can construct confidence intervals for the proportion by using the direct normal approximation to the point estimator or by using Fieller's theorem. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed methods are appropriate for practical use. We provide applications to HIV/AIDS clinical trials.},

  abstract = {The assessment of direct and indirect effects with time-varying mediators and confounders is a common but challenging problem, and standard mediation analysis approaches are generally not applicable in this context. The mediational g-formula was recently proposed to address this problem, paired with a semi-parametric estimation approach to evaluate longitudinal mediation effects empirically. In this paper, we develop a parametric estimation approach to the mediational g-formula, including a feasible algorithm implemented in a freely available SAS macro. In the Framingham Heart Study data, we apply this method to estimate the interventional analogues of natural direct and indirect effects of smoking behaviors sustained over a 10-year period on blood pressure when considering weight change as a time-varying mediator. Compared with not smoking, smoking 20 cigarettes per day for 10 years was estimated to increase blood pressure by 1.2 (95 \% CI: -0.7, 2.7) mm-Hg. The direct effect was estimated to increase blood pressure by 1.5 (95 \% CI: -0.3, 2.9) mm-Hg, and the indirect effect was -0.3 (95\% CI: -0.5, -0.1) mm-Hg, which is negative because smoking which is associated with lower weight is associated in turn with lower blood pressure. These results provide evidence that weight change in fact partially conceals the detrimental effects of cigarette smoking on blood pressure. Our work represents, to our knowledge, the first application of the parametric mediational g-formula in an epidemiologic cohort study.},

Many techniques have been developed for study design and analysis to identify and eliminate such errors. Such problems are not expected to compromise experimental studies, where careful standardization of conditions (for laboratory work) and randomization (for population studies) should, if applied properly, eliminate most such noncausal associations. We argue, however, that a routine precaution taken in the design of biologic laboratory experiments-the use of "negative controls"-is designed to detect both suspected and unsuspected sources of spurious causal inference. In epidemiology, analogous negative controls help to identify and resolve confounding as well as other sources of error, including recall bias or analytic flaws. We distinguish 2 types of negative controls (exposure controls and outcome controls), describe examples of each type from the epidemiologic literature, and identify the conditions for the use of such negative controls to detect confounding. We conclude that negative controls should be more commonly employed in observational studies, and that additional work is needed to specify the conditions under which negative controls will be sensitive detectors of other sources of error in observational studies. \textcopyright{} 2010 by Lippincott Williams \& Wilkins.},

  abstract = {The literature of regression analysis with missing values of the independent variables is reviewed. Six classes of procedures are distinguished: complete case analysis, available case methods, least squares on imputed data, maximum likelihood, Bayesian methods, and multiple imputation. Methods are compared and illustrated when missing data are confined to one independent variable, and extensions to more general patterns are indicated. Attention is paid to the performance of methods when the missing data are not missing completely at random. Least squares methods that fill in missing X's using only data on the X's are contrasted with likelihood-based methods that use data on the X's and Y. The latter approach is preferred and provides methods for elaboration of the basic normal linear regression model. It is suggested that more widely distributed software is needed that advances beyond complete-case analysis, available-case analysis, and naive imputation methods. Bayesian simulation methods and multiple imputation are reviewed; these provide fruitful avenues for future research. \textcopyright{} 1992 Taylor \& Francis Group, LLC.},

  abstract = {Dioxins are persistent environmental pollutants that cause multiple adverse health effects in humans, mainly through binding to the ligand-activated transcription factor, aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). Genetic variation in AhR may modulate the susceptibility to dioxins. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effects of the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) -130 C/T in the AhR promoter on dioxin-inducible gene transcription, and to investigate interleukin-24 (IL-24) and interleukin-1{$\beta$} (IL-1{$\beta$}) as proxies for 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) exposure. Using primary human chorionic stromal cells, we found that cells with the TT genotype showed higher AhR mRNA and protein levels than did those of the CC genotype. Microarray was carried out to analyze the gene expression profiles of cells (CC and TT genotype) after exposing the cells to TCDD. Several genes associated with human disorders were more highly up-regulated in cells of the TT genotype. Higher up-regulation of IL-24 and IL-1{$\beta$} mRNA in cells with the TT genotype was observed. Furthermore, blood samples from 64 Yusho patients who were accidentally exposed to high concentrations of dioxins were analyzed for the genotype, dioxins concentrations and serum levels of IL-24 and IL-1{$\beta$}. We observed higher serum IL-24 levels and lower serum IL-1{$\beta$} levels in Yusho patients with the TT genotype than in those with the CC genotype. AhR SNP -130 C/T affects serum IL-24 and IL-1{$\beta$} levels, independently of serum dioxins concentrations in Yusho patients. Our observations demonstrate that SNP -130 C/T modulates AhR expression and expression levels of IL-24 and IL-1{$\beta$}, and suggest an association of AhR SNP -130 C/T with the susceptibility to dioxins.},

However, such analyses of peer effects or contagion effects have come under criticism because homophily bias may compromise the causal statement. We develop a regression-based approach which leverages a negative control exposure for identification and estimation of contagion effects on additive or multiplicative scales, in the presence of homophily bias.

Individual probabilities of completing the follow-up visit were estimated using baseline demographic and health characteristics. Adjusted risk ratio estimates of racial disparities from complete-case analyses in both incident hypertension (1.11, 95\% confidence interval: 1.02, 1.21) and incident left ventricular hypertrophy (1.02, 95\% confidence interval: 0.84, 1.24) were virtually identical to estimates from inverse probability of attrition weighting and survivor average causal effect.

  abstract = {[BACKGROUND] Many studies have examined `non-specific' vaccine effects on infant mortality: attention has been particularly drawn to diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) vaccine, which has been proposed to be associated with an increased mortality risk. Both right and left censoring are common in such studies. [METHOD] We conducted simulation studies examining right censoring (at measles vaccination) and left censoring (by excluding early follow-up) in a variety of scenarios in which confounding was and was not present. We estimated both unadjusted and adjusted hazard ratios (HRs), averaged across simulations. [RESULTS] We identified scenarios in which right-censoring at measles vaccination was informative and so introduced bias in the direction of a detrimental effect of DTP vaccine. In some, but not all, situations, adjusting for confounding by health status removed the bias caused by censoring. However, such adjustment will not always remove bias due to informative censoring: inverse probability weighting was required in one scenario. Bias due to left censoring arose when both health status and DTP vaccination were associated with mortality during the censored early follow-up and was in the direction of attenuating a beneficial effect of DTP on mortality. Such bias was more severe when the effect of DTP changed over time. [CONCLUSIONS] Estimates of non-specific effects of vaccines may be biased by informative right or left censoring. Authors of studies estimating such effects should consider the potential for such bias and use appropriate statistical approaches to control for it. Such approaches require measurement of prognostic factors that predict censoring.},

Although it is now accepted that the central nervous system undergoes constant immune surveillance that takes place within the meningeal compartment, the mechanisms governing the entrance and exit of immune cells from the central nervous system remain poorly understood. In searching for T-cell gateways into and out of the meninges, we discovered functional lymphatic vessels lining the dural sinuses. These structures express all of the molecular hallmarks of lymphatic endothelial cells, are able to carry both fluid and immune cells from the cerebrospinal fluid, and are connected to the deep cervical lymph nodes. The unique location of these vessels may have impeded their discovery to date, thereby contributing to the long-held concept of the absence of lymphatic vasculature in the central nervous system. The discovery of the central nervous system lymphatic system may call for a reassessment of basic assumptions in neuroimmunology and sheds new light on the aetiology of neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases associated with immune system dysfunction.},

  abstract = {Background: Intention-to-treat comparisons of randomized trials provide asymptotically consistent estimators of the effect of treatment assignment, without regard to compliance. However, decision makers often wish to know the effect of a per-protocol comparison. Moreover, decision makers may also wish to know the effect of treatment assignment or treatment protocol in a user-specified target population other than the sample in which the trial was fielded. Here, we aimed to generalize results from the ACTG A5095 trial to the US recently HIV-diagnosed target population. Methods: We first replicated the published conventional intention-to-treat estimate (2-year risk difference and hazard ratio) comparing a four-drug antiretroviral regimen to a three-drug regimen in the A5095 trial. We then estimated the intention-to-treat effect that accounted for informative dropout and the per-protocol effect that additionally accounted for protocol deviations by constructing inverse probability weights. Furthermore, we employed inverse odds of sampling weights to generalize both intention-to-treat and per-protocol effects to a target population comprising US individuals with HIV diagnosed during 2008\textendash 2014. Results: Of 761 subjects in the analysis, 82 dropouts (36 in the three-drug arm and 46 in the four-drug arm) and 59 protocol deviations (25 in the three-drug arm and 34 in the four-drug arm) occurred during the first 2 years of follow-up. A total of 169 subjects incurred virologic failure or death. The 2-year risks were similar both in the trial and in the US HIV-diagnosed target population for estimates from the conventional intention-to-treat, dropout-weighted intention-to-treat, and per-protocol analyses. In the US target population, the 2-year conventional intention-to-treat risk difference (unit: \%) for virologic failure or death comparing the four-drug arm to the three-drug arm was -0.4 (95\% confidence interval: -6.2, 5.1), while the hazard ratio was 0.97 (95\% confidence interval: 0.70, 1.34); the 2-year risk difference was -0.9 (95\% confidence interval: -6.9, 5.3) for the dropout-weighted intention-to-treat comparison (hazard ratio = 0.95, 95\% confidence interval: 0.68, 1.32) and -0.7 (95\% confidence interval: -6.7, 5.5) for the per-protocol comparison (hazard ratio = 0.96, 95\% confidence interval: 0.69, 1.34). Conclusion: No benefit of four-drug antiretroviral regimen over three-drug regimen was found from the conventional intention-to-treat, dropout-weighted intention-to-treat or per-protocol estimates in the trial sample or target population.},

  abstract = {Objectives. Implicit in the modern concept of patient outcome assessment is a shift from primary reliance on clinical indicators to a broader definition that includes physical, psychological, and social well-being. This is especially true of prostate cancer, where treatment can profoundly alter patient well-being. We have initiated a longitudinal observational database, CaPSURE (Cancer of the Prostate Strategic Urologic Research Endeavor) to document the impact of prostate cancer on resource utilization, clinical outcomes, health-related quality of life, and survival in typical practice settings. Methods. Observational databases have been used in the treatment of other conditions. We have incorporated many well-tested elements in our study. Data are collected from two sources: the physician and the patient. The urologist enrolls eligible patients into the study, completes a medical history, and records current status, treatment, and laboratory results at each office visit. Patients complete quarterly questionnaires on health- related quality of life, resource utilization, work loss, and satisfaction with care. Results. Currently 21 sites participate in CaPSURE with 1419 patients enrolled by April 1996. Twenty percent of patients are newly diagnosed with prostate cancer. Time since diagnosis averages 3.0 years (SD = 3.1); mean age at diagnosis is 68.9 years (SD = 7.9, range = 39.6 to 90.7). The majority of patients (72\%) are diagnosed with Stage B cancer. Patients receive a variety of treatments including surgery, irradiation, hormonal therapy, and watchful waiting. Conclusions. Information available from CaPSURE will assist practicing urologists who must make clinical decisions on the basis of data such as the results of treatment in typical care settings, the effect of prostate cancer and its treatment methods on patient quality of life, and the effect on health care costs of the early detection of prostate cancer.},

  abstract = {A three-part hypothesis is proposed to explain the unusual epidemiology of gastroschisis, a congenital abnormality of the abdominal wall, which has a rising frequency, a higher rate in first and young mothers in whites but not blacks, and a unique negative correlation with obesity. The hypothesis involves: (1) An early estrogenic thrombophilia, (2) racial differences in thrombosis, and (3) thrombotic by-products interfering with early developmental signaling. For the first: (1) An estrogenic thrombophilia is a known effect. (2) A mouse model links excess estrogen to thromboses affecting the fetus. (3) Young and first mothers have higher first trimester estrogen levels. (4) A negative correlation between body mass index and pregnancy estradiol accounts for the weight relationship. (5) Maternal alcohol raises estrogen levels in premenopausal women. (6) A link with atrazine, an estrogenic endocrine disruptor, has been found, and rising frequencies of gastroschisis make this and other such chemicals a particular concern if estrogen is indeed involved. For the second: Blacks have a different thrombophilic gene background and less of a thrombotic response to estrogen than whites, explaining racial differences. For the third: Protein palmitoylation affects cell signaling in development, and lipid rafts, a major aspect of thromboses, facilitate this process. Such thrombotic byproducts could be the source of palmitic acid rich amniotic vacuoles with gastroschisis. Similar vacuoles can occur with limb-body wall defects, another early developmental anomaly associated with decreased maternal age that may have a similar pathogenesis. Later thrombotic related anomalies with a similar epidemiology seem to primarily involve vascular disruptions, but localized signaling anomalies may also occur. \textcopyright{} 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Therefore, a questionnaire was sent to 1614 couples with a child conceived by intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) aged 4-6 years. A total of 899 couples responded (response rate 55.7\%). A total of 10.9\% of couples had used contraception. Of the couples that had actively tried to conceive, 20.0\% had conceived spontaneously, resulting in a live-birth rate of 16.4\%. 74.5\% of these pregnancies were conceived within 2 years after delivery. A further 26.6\% of couples conceived again by ICSI, with a live-birth rate of 20.9\%. Maternal age was the only prognostic factor for spontaneous conception. Parents of multiples after ICSI did not have a higher chance of spontaneous conception than parents of singletons. Couples can be counselled that one out of five couples conceive spontaneously after successful ICSI. Even when assuming that none of the families that were lost to follow-up had conceived spontaneously, one out of eight couples would have conceived spontaneously. Therefore, it is important to counsel patients about the possibility of natural conception and necessity to use contraception despite their history of subfertility. \textcopyright{} 2008 Published by Reproductive Healthcare Ltd.},

This estimation problem is addressed in a statistical model for the data distribution that is nonparametric, beyond possible knowledge about the treatment and censoring mechanisms. We propose data adaptive estimators of this optimal dynamic regime which are defined by sequential loss-based learning under both the blip function and weighted classification frameworks. Rather than a priori selecting an estimation framework and algorithm, we propose combining estimators from both frameworks using a super-learning based cross-validation selector that seeks to minimize an appropriate cross-validated risk. The resulting selector is guaranteed to asymptotically perform as well as the best convex combination of candidate algorithms in terms of loss-based dissimilarity under conditions. We offer simulation results to support our theoretical findings.},

  abstract = {Objective. To determine whether there is a relationship between clinically meaningful behavior problems and concurrent and future overweight in 8- to 11-year-old children. Methods. 1998 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth interview data for 8- to 11-year-old children and their mothers were analyzed. A Behavior Problems Index score {$>$}90th percentile was considered clinically meaningful. Child overweight was defined as a body mass index (BMI) {$>$}95th percentile for age and sex. Multiple logistic regression was used to control for potential confounders (selected a priori): child's sex, race, use of behavior-modifying medication, history of academic retention, and hours of television per day; maternal obesity, smoking status, marital status, education, and depressive symptoms; family poverty status; and Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment-Short Form (HOME-SF) cognitive stimulation score. In an attempt to elucidate temporal sequence, a second analysis was conducted with a subsample of normal-weight children who became overweight between 1996 and 1998 while controlling for BMI z score in 1996. Results. The sample included 755 mother-child pairs. Of the potential confounding Variables, race, maternal obesity, academic grade retention, maternal education, poverty status, and HOME-SF cognitive stimulation score acted as joint confounders, altering the relationship between behavior problems and overweight in the multiple logistic regression model. With these covariates in the final model, behavior problems were independently associated with concurrent child overweight (adjusted odds ratio: 2.95; 95\% confidence interval: 1.34-6.49). The relationship was strengthened in the subsample of previously normal-weight children, with race, maternal obesity, HOME-SF cognitive stimulation score, and 1996 BMI z score acting as confounders (adjusted odds ratio: 5.23; 95\% confidence interval: 1.37-19.9). Conclusions. Clinically meaningful behavior problems in 8- to 11-year-old children were independently associated with an increased risk of concurrent overweight and becoming overweight in previously normal-weight children.},

It is unknown how disparities in infant mortality among FN versus non-FN women have changed over time in urban versus rural areas.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nMETHODS: We conducted a birth cohort-based study of all 877 925 live births (56 771 FN and 821 154 non-FN) registered in British Columbia, 1981-2000. Main outcomes included rates, risk differences, and relative risks of neonatal, postneonatal, and overall infant death.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nRESULTS: Both neonatal and postneonatal mortality rates for FN infants showed a steady decline in rural areas but a rise-and-fall pattern in urban areas. Relative risks for overall infant death among FN versus non-FN infants declined steadily from 2.75 (95\% CI: 2.04, 3.72) to 1.87 (95\% CI: 1.24, 2.81) in rural areas from 1981-1984 to 1997-2000, but rose from 1.59 (95\% CI: 1.27, 1.99) (1981-1984) to 2.80 (2.33-3.37) (1989-92) and then fell to 1.89 (1.44-2.49) (1997-2000) in urban areas. Risk differences for neonatal death among FN versus non-FN infants declined substantially over time in rural but not urban areas. The disparities in neonatal death among FN versus non-FN were largely explained by differences in preterm birth, while the disparities in postneonatal death were not explained by observed maternal and pregnancy characteristics.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSIONS: Reductions in disparities in infant mortality among FN versus non-FN women have been less substantial and consistent over time in urban versus rural areas of British Columbia, suggesting the need for greater attention to FN maternal and infant health in urban areas.},

There is evidence in animal models that maternal exposure to PAHs during pregnancy is associated with gastroschisis in offspring; however, to our knowledge, no human studies examining this association have been conducted., Objective: Our goal was to conduct a case\textendash control study assessing the association between estimated maternal occupational exposure to PAHs and gastroschisis in offspring., Methods: Data from gastroschisis cases and control infants were obtained from the population-based National Birth Defects Prevention Study for the period 1997\textendash 2002. Exposure to PAHs was assigned by industrial hygienist consensus, based on self-reported maternal occupational histories from 1 month before conception through the third month of pregnancy. Logistic regression was used to determine the association between estimated occupational PAH exposure and gastroschisis among children whose mothers were employed for at least 1 month during the month before conception through the third month of pregnancy., Results: The prevalence of estimated occupational PAH exposure was 9.0\% in case mothers (27 of 299) and 3.6\% in control mothers (107 of 2,993). Logistic regression analyses indicated a significant association between occupational PAHs and gastroschisis among mothers {$\geq$} 20 years of age [odds ratio (OR) = 2.53; 95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.27, 5.04] after adjusting for maternal body mass index, education, gestational diabetes, and smoking. This association was not seen in mothers {$<$} 20 years (OR = 1.14; 95\% CI: 0.55, 2.33), which is notable because although young maternal age is the strongest known risk factor for gastroschisis, most cases are born to mothers {$\geq$} 20 years., Conclusion: Our findings indicate an association between occupational exposure to PAHs among mothers who are {$\geq$} 20 years and gastroschisis. These results contribute to a body of evidence that PAHs may be teratogenic.},

We used meta-analysis to evaluate the reproductive risks of cocaine. We reviewed the 45 scientific papers published in the English language dealing with effects of cocaine used during pregnancy on pregnancy outcome in humans, and identified 20 papers eligible for meta-analysis (cocaine use in pregnancy, pregnancy/fetal outcome studies, human studies, original work, cohort or case control studies, control group present, English language). Our analysis revealed that very few adverse reproductive effects could be shown to be significantly associated with cocaine use by polydrug users when compared to control groups of polydrug users not using cocaine [genitourinary malformations; odds ratio of 6.08 (95\% CI 1.18-31.3); gestation age: Cohen's d 0.37 (CI 0.2-0.55)]. When the control groups consisted of no drug users, the polydrug users abusing cocaine had a higher risk for spontaneous abortions [odds ration 10.50 (CI 11.74-64.1)]. Similarly, comparison of users of cocaine alone or no drug users revealed a higher risk for in utero death, in addition to genitourinary tract malformations. Analysis of continuous variables (head circumference, gestational age, birth weight and length) revealed that the effect size was dependent upon the nature of the comparison. Comparison of cocaine users to no drug users consistently yielded a medium effect size (Cohen's d) between 0.50 and 0.58, while comparison of polydrug/cocaine users to polydrug/no cocaine users provided effect sizes small to non existent (0.06-0.37). These discrepancies suggest that a variety of adverse reproductive effects commonly quoted to be associated with maternal use of cocaine may be caused by confounding factors clustering in cocaine users.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Over the past 10 years, research into environmental risk factors for autism has grown dramatically, bringing evidence that an array of non-genetic factors acting during the prenatal period may influence neurodevelopment. METHODS: This paper reviews the evidence on modifiable preconception and/or prenatal factors that have been associated, in some studies, with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), including nutrition, substance use and exposure to environmental agents. This review is restricted to human studies with at least 50 cases of ASD, having a valid comparison group, conducted within the past decade and focusing on maternal lifestyle or environmental chemicals. RESULTS: Higher maternal intake of certain nutrients and supplements has been associated with reduction in ASD risk, with the strongest evidence for periconceptional folic acid supplements. Although many investigations have suggested no impact of maternal smoking and alcohol use on ASD, more rigorous exposure assessment is needed. A number of studies have demonstrated significant increases in ASD risk with estimated exposure to air pollution during the prenatal period, particularly for heavy metals and particulate matter. Little research has assessed other persistent and non-persistent organic pollutants in association with ASD specifically. CONCLUSIONS: More work is needed to examine fats, vitamins and other maternal nutrients, as well as endocrine-disrupting chemicals and pesticides, in association with ASD, given sound biological plausibility and evidence regarding other neurodevelopmental deficits. The field can be advanced by large-scale epidemiological studies, attention to critical aetiological windows and how these vary by exposure, and use of biomarkers and other means to understand underlying mechanisms.},

  abstract = {Background: Children who witness interparental violence are at a heightened risk for developing psychosocial, behavioral and cognitive problems, as well as posttraumatic stress symptoms. For these children the psycho-educational secondary prevention program 'En nu ik...!' ('It's my turn now!') has been developed. This program includes specific therapeutic factors focused on emotion awareness and expression, increasing feelings of emotional security, teaching specific coping strategies, developing a trauma narrative, improving parent-child interaction and psycho-education. The main study aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of the specific therapeutic factors in the program. A secondary objective is to study mediating and moderating factors.Methods/design: This study is a prospective multicenter randomized controlled trial across cities in the Netherlands. Participants (N = 140) are referred to the secondary preventive intervention program by police, social work, women shelters and youth (mental health) care. Children, aged 6-12 years, and their parents, who experienced interparental violence are randomly assigned to either the intervention program or the control program. The control program is comparable on nonspecific factors by offering positive attention, positive expectations, recreation, distraction, warmth and empathy of the therapist, and social support among group participants, in ways that are similar to the intervention program. Primary outcome measures are posttraumatic stress symptoms and emotional and behavioral problems of the child. Mediators tested are the ability to differentiate and express emotions, emotional security, coping strategies, feelings of guilt and parent-child interaction. Mental health of the parent, parenting stress, disturbances in parent-child attachment, duration and severity of the domestic violence and demographics are examined for their moderating effect. Data are collected one week before the program starts (T1), and one week (T2) and six months (T3) after finishing the program. Both intention-to-treat and completer analyses will be done.Discussion: Adverse outcomes after witnessing interparental violence are highly diverse and may be explained by multiple risk factors. An important question for prevention programs is therefore to what extent a specific focus on potential psychotrauma is useful. This trial may point to several directions for optimizing public health response to children's exposure to interparental violence.Trial registration: Netherlands Trial Register (NTR): NTR3064. \textcopyright{} 2012 Overbeek et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION:It has been suggested that hormonal risk factors act predominantly on estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor (ER/PR)-positive breast cancers. However, the data have been inconsistent, especially in younger women.METHODS:We evaluated the impact of age at menarche, pregnancy history, duration of breastfeeding, body mass index, combined oral contraceptive use, and alcohol consumption on breast cancer risk by ER/PR status in 1,725 population-based case patients and 440 control subjects aged 20 to 49 years identified within neighborhoods of case patients. We used multivariable unconditional logistic regression methods to conduct case-control comparisons overall as well as by ER/PR status of the cases, and to compare ER+PR+ with ER-PR- case patients.RESULTS:The number of full-term pregnancies was inversely associated with the risk of ER+PR+ breast cancer (ptrend = 0.005), whereas recent average alcohol consumption was associated with an increased risk of ER+PR+ breast cancer (ptrend = 0.03). Neither of these two factors was associated with the risk of ER- PR- breast cancer. Late age at menarche and a longer duration of breastfeeding were both associated with decreased breast cancer risk, irrespective of receptor status (all ptrend[less than or equal to] 0.03).CONCLUSION:Our results suggest that the number of full-term pregnancies and recent alcohol consumption affect breast cancer risk in younger women predominantly through estrogen and progesterone mediated by their respective receptors. Late age at menarche and breastfeeding may act through different hormonal mechanisms.},

  abstract = {Background: Primary prevention efforts for both gastroschisis and omphalocele are limited by the lack of known risk factors. Our objective was to investigate associations between potential maternal risk factors and gastroschisis and omphalocele within a large population-based sample of participants enrolled in the National Birth Defects Prevention Study (NBDPS). Methods: Demographic, health-related, and environmental exposure data from the NBDPS were collected from women with expected delivery dates between October 1997 and December 2003. Data were collected on 485 cases of gastroschisis, 168 cases of omphalocele, and 4967 controls. Results: Women who had offspring with gastroschisis were younger (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 0.84; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.81-0.86) and less likely to be black (AOR, 0.54; 95\% CI, 0.34-0.85) than controls. They also were more likely to have smoked (AOR, 1.51; 95\% CI, 1.12-2.03), taken ibuprofen (AOR, 1.61; 95\% CI, 1.23-2.10), and consumed alcohol (AOR, 1.38; 95\% CI, 1.06-1.79) than controls. Women who had offspring with omphaloceles were more likely to have consumed alcohol (AOR, 1.53; 95\% CI, 1.04-2.25) and be heavy smokers (AOR, 4.26; 95\% CI, 1.58-11.52) than controls. Conclusions: Our results suggest a moderately increased risk of gastroschisis among women who used tobacco, alcohol, and ibuprofen during early pregnancy. A modestly elevated risk was observed for omphaloceles among women who used alcohol during the first trimester and among women who were heavy smokers. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Traditional methods in survival analysis do not make use of available data on these markers to recover additional information from censored individuals. Using a heuristic modification of the redistribution to the right algorithm (Efron, 1967), a new approach for recovering information for censored individuals using disease markers is proposed. Additionally, the statistical properties of the proposed method are examined. There are two possible advantages to this modification: (i) bias reduction when censoring is informative, and (ii) an increase in efficiency in the case of truly noninformative censoring. \textcopyright{} 1995 Biometrika Trust.},

Design Retrospective cohort study. Setting South Carolina, USA. Population A total of 78 675 mother-child pairs, insured by the South Carolina Medicaid programme, born in the period 2004-2007. Methods We analysed South Carolina Medicaid data, linked to data from both the South Carolina Department of Education (DOE) and the South Carolina Department of Disabilities and Special Needs (DDSN). Maternal pre-pregnancy BMI and weight change during pregnancy were obtained from birth certificates. ID cases were identified from the three sources listed above. We used generalised estimating equation logistic regression models to model the odds of ID in children. Main outcome measures Identified as having ID in special education, DDSN, or Medicaid billing records. Results The risk of ID was greater in children of women with pre-pregnancy obesity, and the risk was greatest in children born to women with morbid obesity (OR 1.52, 95\% CI 1.30-1.77 for ID of any severity; OR 1.73, 95\% CI 1.23-2.45 for severe ID). Gestational weight change (gain or loss) was not significantly associated with odds of ID. Conclusions Pre-pregnancy obesity may be a modifiable risk factor for ID in children, although further study is needed to evaluate whether the association meets criteria for causation.

These effects represent a spectrum of structural anomalies and neurocognitive and behavioral disabilities that have recently been termed fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Children at the most severe end of this spectrum and displaying the complete phenotype of characteristic facial anomalies, growth retardation and developmental abnormalities of the central nervous system are defined as having fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). While FAS is the most readily clinically recognized form of FASD, other categories within the continuum of adverse effects due to prenatal alcohol exposure are becoming better defined. These include partial fetal alcohol syndrome (PFAS), alcohol-related birth defects (ARBD) and alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND). As more is learned regarding the exact manifestations of alcohol on brain development, these classifications may be expanded and/or refined. Because FASD represents a major public health concern, early recognition of at-risk children is important for initiating interventional strategies. Thus, the purpose of this report is to educate practicing physicians about the recognizable phenotypes of FASD in order to accurately identify these children and implement the most appropriate management plans. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {A probability distribution may have some properties that are stable under a structure (e.g., a causal graph) and other properties that are unstable. Stable properties are implied by the structure and thus will be shared by populations following the structure. In contrast, unstable properties correspond to special circumstances that are unlikely to be replicated across those populations. A probability distribution is faithful to the structure if all independencies in the distribution are logical consequences of the structure. We explore the distinction between confounding and noncollapsibility in relation to the concepts of faithfulness and stability. Simple collapsibility of an odds ratio over a risk factor is unstable and thus unlikely if the exposure affects the outcome, whether or not the risk factor is associated with exposure. For a binary exposure with no effect, collapsibility over a confounder also requires unfaithfulness. Nonetheless, if present, simple collapsibility of the odds ratio limits the degree of confounding by the covariate. Collapsibility of effect measures is stable if the covariate is independent of the outcome given exposure, but it is unstable if the covariate is an instrumental variable. Understanding stable and unstable properties of distributions under causal structures, and the distinction between stability and faithfulness, yields important insights into the correspondence between noncollapsibility and confounding.},

  abstract = {Many exposures of epidemiological interest are time varying, and the values of potential confounders may change over time leading to time varying confounding. The aim of many longitudinal studies is to estimate the causal effect of a time varying exposure on an outcome that requires adjusting for time varying confounding. Time varying confounding affected by previous exposure often occurs in practice, but it is usually adjusted for by using conventional analytical methods such as time dependent Cox regression, random effects models, or generalised estimating equations, which are known to provide biased effect estimates in this setting. This article explains time varying confounding affected by previous exposure and outlines three causal methods proposed to appropriately adjust for this potential bias: inverse-probability-of-treatment weighting, the parametric G formula, and G estimation.},

  abstract = {The use of propensity scores to adjust for measured confounding factors has become increasingly popular in cohort studies. However, their use in case-control and case-cohort studies has received little attention. The authors present some theory on the estimation and use of propensity scores in case-control and case-cohort studies and present the results of simulation studies that examine whether large-sample expectations are realized in studies of typical size. The application of propensity scores is less straightforward in case-control and case-cohort studies than in cohort studies. The authors' simulations revealed two potentially important issues. First, when using several potential approaches, there is artifactual effect modification of the odds ratio by level of propensity score. The magnitude of this phenomenon decreases as the sample size increases. Second, several potential approaches produce estimated propensity scores that do not converge to the true value as sample size increases and, thus, can fail to adjust fully for measured confounding factors. However, the magnitude of residual confounding appeared modest in our simulations. Researchers considering using propensity scores in case-control or case-cohort studies should consider the potential for artifactual effect modification and their reduced ability to control for potential confounding factors.},

However, participation rates in testing for surveillance conducted as part of household surveys, on which many of these estimates are based, can be low. HIV positive individuals may be less likely to participate because they fear disclosure, in which case estimates obtained using conventional approaches to deal with missing data, such as imputation-based methods, will be biased. We develop a Heckman-type simultaneous equation approach that accounts for nonignorable selection, but unlike previous implementations, allows for spatial dependence and does not impose a homogenous selection process on all respondents. In addition, our framework addresses the issue of separation, where for instance some factors are severely unbalanced and highly predictive of the response, which would ordinarily prevent model convergence. Estimation is carried out within a penalized likelihood framework where smoothing is achieved using a parameterization of the smoothing criterion, which makes estimation more stable and efficient. We provide the software for straightforward implementation of the proposed approach, and apply our methodology to estimating national and sub-national HIV prevalence in Swaziland, Zimbabwe, and Zambia.

  abstract = {STUDY QUESTION: Are the levels of biologically active and the most toxic dioxin-like substances in adipose tissue of patients with deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE) higher than in a control group without endometriosis? SUMMARY ANSWER: DIE patients have higher levels of dioxins and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in adipose tissue compared with controls without endometriosis. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Some studies have investigated the levels of dioxin-like substances, in serum samples, in patients with endometriosis, with inconsistent results. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Case-control study including two groups of patients. The study group (DIE group) consisted of 30 patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery because of DIE. In all patients, an extensive preoperative work-up was performed including clinical exploration, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and transvaginal sonography. All patients with DIE underwent a confirmatory histological study for DIE after surgery. The non-endometriosis control group (control group), included the next consecutive patient undergoing laparoscopic surgery in our center due to adnexal benign gynecological disease (ovarian or tubal procedures other than endometriosis) after each DIE patient, and who did not present any type of endometriosis. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: During the surgical procedure 1-2 g of adipose tissue from the omentum were obtained. Dioxin-like substances were analyzed in adipose tissue in DIE patients and controls without endometriosis. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: The total toxic equivalence and concentrations of both dioxins and PCBs were significantly higher in patients with DIE in comparison with the control group (P {$<$} 0.05), mainly due to the significantly higher values of the two most toxic dioxins (2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin [2,3,7,8-TCDD] and 1,2,3,7,8-pentachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin [1,2,3,7,8-PeCDD]) (P {$<$} 0.01 for each compound). The levels of furan 2,3,4,7,8-PeCDF were statistically higher in the DIE group compared with controls. Only four congeners of PCBs had toxic equivalence values and concentrations that were statistically higher in patients with DIE, but these included the most toxic and carcinogenic PCB-126 (PCB-114 P {$<$} 0.05; PCB-156 P {$<$} 0.05; PCB-189 P = 0.04; PCB-126 P {$<$} 0.01). LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Since few patients were recruited, the study is only exploratory. Our results need to be confirmed in larger and more heterogeneous population studies since environmental and even genetic factors involved in determining dioxins and PCBs widely vary in different countries. Furthermore, the strict eligibility criteria used may preclude generalization of the results to other populations and the surgery-based sampling frame may induce a selection bias. Finally, adipose tissue was obtained only from the omentum, and not from other adipose tissue of the body. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Our results suggest a potential role of dioxin-like substances in the pathogenesis of DIE. Further studies are warranted to confirm our findings. STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTERESTS: None. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: Not applicable.},

Within same sex sibling pairs, differences in birth weight were directly associated with differences in IQ in boys (812 pairs, predicted IQ difference per 100 g change in birth weight =0.50, 95\% confidence interval 0.28 to 0.71) but not girls (871 pairs, 0.10, -0.09 to 0.30).

Simultaneously, this work has weakened identifying assumptions, yielding effects that are more practically relevant. Most work in dynamic interventions to date has focused on settings where we directly alter some unconfounded treatment of interest. In policy analysis, decision makers rarely have this level of control over behaviours or access to experimental data. Instead, they are often faced with treatments that they can affect only indirectly and whose effects must be learned from observational data. We propose new estimands and estimators of causal effects based on dynamic interventions with instrumental variables. This method does not rely on parametric models and does not require an experiment. Instead, we estimate the effect of treatment induced by a dynamic intervention on an instrument. This robustness should reassure policy makers that these estimates can be used to inform policy effectively. We demonstrate the usefulness of this estimation strategy in a case-study examining the effect of visitation on recidivism.},

The key to the program was the training of a cadre of trainers/advocates in all local Native American and Alaska Native communities served by the Indian Health Service. These people were then supported and assisted in their efforts through a variety of means. Evaluation results of knowledge gained indicate that the local trainers had substantial success in imparting FAS information to a variety of audiences (prenatal groups, school children and community groups). Further, the evaluation samples also indicate that the knowledge was retained by the groups over time (2-4 months) and that there may have been some general diffusion of knowledge among peers in local communities.

  abstract = {Women proven to be extremely high risk for drinking during pregnancy were provided case management (CM) enhanced with strategies derived from motivational interviewing (MI) as a part of a comprehensive Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) epidemiology and prevention program in four American Indian communities in Northern Plains states. Data on the first women enrolled (n=131) revealed that they have extreme issues with alcohol abuse to overcome. Sixty-five percent of these women have experienced extensive alcohol use within their immediate family. At intake, 24\% of CM clients reported binge drinking one or more days in the preceding week. Heavy drinking resulted in estimated blood alcohol concentrations (BAC) as high as .576 using the BACCUS methodology. Project staff has attempted to actively engage each of these women in CM. Clients have been in CM an average of 17.2 months (SD=16.6). The mean number of significant contacts (face-to-face or telephone MI sessions) was 19. Thirty-one percent of the women entered some type of formal alcohol or drug treatment while in CM. Data were collected at 6 month intervals from 6 to 72 months after enrollment. Consumption of alcohol, as measured by both quantity and frequency measures, was reduced at 6 months. Thirty-eight percent of enrolled women reported complete abstinence from alcohol use at 6 months, and the number of binges while drinking in CM declined significantly from 15 at baseline to 4.3 at 6 months. However, mean peak BACs for the heavy drinking sessions were still problematic for those who continued to drink. They ranged from .234 to .275 from baseline to 12 month follow-up, but the total number of binges was reduced substantially at 12 months as well. Furthermore, the most important outcomes are the status of the children born while in CM. One hundred and forty nine pregnancies have occurred among these women, and 76\% of those pregnancies have resulted in normal deliveries, and only two children born in CM are suspected of having some form of severe FASD. At 6, 12, 18, and 24 month follow-up milestones, 70\% of the women who were not currently pregnant were protected from having a child with FAS by not drinking, using birth control, or both. Other measures of CM success include enrolling in school, regaining custody of children, completing substance abuse treatment, probation from the criminal justice system, substantial periods of abstinence, enrolling in programs to improve life skills, and employment.},

  abstract = {Bias due to selective mortality is a potential concern in many studies and is especially relevant in cognitive aging research because cognitive impairment strongly predicts subsequent mortality. Biased estimation of the effect of an exposure on rate of cognitive decline can occur when mortality is a common effect of exposure and an unmeasured determinant of cognitive decline and in similar settings. This potential is often represented as collider-stratification bias in directed acyclic graphs, but it is difficult to anticipate the magnitude of bias. In this paper, we present a flexible simulation platform with which to quantify the expected bias in longitudinal studies of determinants of cognitive decline. We evaluated potential survival bias in naive analyses under several selective survival scenarios, assuming that exposure had no effect on cognitive decline for anyone in the population. Compared with the situation with no collider bias, the magnitude of bias was higher when exposure and an unmeasured determinant of cognitive decline interacted on the hazard ratio scale to influence mortality or when both exposure and rate of cognitive decline influenced mortality. Bias was, as expected, larger in high-mortality situations. This simulation platform provides a flexible tool for evaluating biases in studies with high mortality, as is common in cognitive aging research.},

  abstract = {The low-birth-weight infant remains at much higher risk of mortality than the infant with normal weight at birth. In the neonatal period, when most infant deaths occur, the proportion of low-birth-weight infants, especially those with very low weight, is the major determinant of the magnitude of the mortality rates. Furthermore, differences in low-birth-weight rates account for the higher neonatal mortality rates observed in some groups, particularly those characterized by socioeconomic disadvantages. Much of the recent decline in neonatal mortality can be attributed to increased survival among low-birth-weight infants, apparently as a result of hospital-based services. The application of these services is currently considered cost-effective, although whether this will continue to be true in the future is unclear because of the increased survival of very tiny infants. Although low-birth-weight infants remain at increased risk of both postneonatal mortality and morbidity in infancy and early childhood, the risk is substantially smaller than that of neonatal death. In addition, these adverse later outcomes have not offset the gains achieved in the neonatal period. Nonetheless, the increased survival of high-risk infants raises concern about their future requirements for special medical and educational services and about the stress on their families. Despite increased access to antenatal services, only moderate declines in the proportion of low-birth-weight infants has been observed, and almost no change has occurred in the proportion of those with very low weight at birth. In addition, in many areas of the country the birth-weight-specific neonatal mortality rates are similar for groups at high and low risk of neonatal death. In view of these findings, continuation of the current decline in neonatal mortality and reduction of the mortality differentials between high- and low-risk groups require the identification and more effective implementation of strategies for the prevention of low-weight births.},

(2) What are the correlates of school difficulty? (3) Are behavior problems associated with school difficulty when variables are controlled for these correlates? The analysis revealed that 34\% of very low birth weight children could be characterized as having school difficulty, compared with 20\% and 14\% of the other groups, respectively, and that they were more likely to have higher scores on the hyperactive subscale of the Behavior Problems Index. Although a broad array of sociodemographic factors correlated with school difficulty, very low birth weight and hyperactivity scores contributed independently to the risk of academic problems. We conclude that very low birth weight infants are at risk of having school problems that are in part associated with hyperactive behavior.},

The objective of this prospective cohort analysis was to identify maternal, socioeconomic, and child correlates of psychomotor and mental development in the first 18 mo of life among Tanzanian infants born to HIV-infected women. We hypothesized that child HIV infection, morbidity, and undernutrition would be associated with lower developmental status when taking into consideration maternal health and socioeconomic factors. Baseline maternal characteristics were recorded during pregnancy, birth characteristics were collected immediately after delivery, infant micronutrient status was measured at 6 wk and 6 mo, and anthropometric measurements and morbidity histories were performed at monthly follow-up visits. The Psychomotor Development Index (PDI) and Mental Development Index (MDI) of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development, 2nd edition (BSID-II) were used to assess developmental functioning at 6, 12, and 18 mo of age. Multivariate repeated regression models with time-varying covariates were used to estimate adjusted mean MDI and PDI scores for each level of the variables. A total of 311 infants contributed {$\geq$}1 BSID-II assessments for 657 PDI and 655 MDI measurements. Of infants, 51\% were male, 23\% were born preterm, 7\% were low birth weight, and 10\% were HIV-positive at 6 wk. Preterm birth, child HIV infection, stunting, and wasting were independently associated with lower PDI and MDI scores. Strategies to lower mother-to-child transmission of HIV, prevent preterm birth, and enhance child growth could contribute to improved child psychomotor and mental development.},

Methods Retrospective cohort study of women with HR-HPV at entry to prenatal care compared with those with at least 2 normal pap smears. Preeclampsia was defined by clinical guidelines. Unadjusted and adjusted analyses were performed. Results Three hundred fourteen women with HR-HPV matched with 628 women with normal pap smears. Exposed HR-HPV patients were younger, had lower body mass index, systolic and diastolic blood pressure at entry to care, and more likely to be nulliparous and smokers.

Bias is evident when estimating influenza vaccine effectiveness, even after adjustment for claims-based indicators of illness. We explored bias reduction methods while estimating vaccine effectiveness in a cohort of adult hemodialysis patients. Using the United States Renal Data System and linked data from a commercial dialysis provider, we estimated vaccine effectiveness using a Cox proportional hazards marginal structural model of all-cause mortality before and during 3 influenza seasons in 2005/2006 through 2007/2008. To improve confounding control, we added frailty indicators to the model, measured time-varying confounders at different time intervals, and restricted the sample in multiple ways. Crude and baseline-adjusted marginal structural models remained strongly biased. Restricting to a healthier population removed some unmeasured confounding; however, this reduced the sample size, resulting in wide confidence intervals. We estimated an influenza vaccine effectiveness of 9\% (hazard ratio = 0.91, 95\% confidence interval: 0.72, 1.15) when bias was minimized through cohort restriction. In this study, the healthy-user bias could not be controlled through statistical adjustment; however, sample restriction reduced much of the bias.},

When using observational data, estimating those effects requires adjustment for confounding. However, conventional regression methods cannot appropriately adjust for confounding in the presence of treatment-confounder feedback. In contrast, estimators derived from Robins's g-formula may correctly adjust for confounding even if treatment-confounder feedback exists. The package gfoRmula implements in R one such estimator: the parametric g-formula. This estimator can be used to estimate the effects of binary or continuous time-varying treatments as well as contrasts defined by static or dynamic, deterministic, or random interventions, as well as interventions that depend on the natural value of treatment. The package accommodates survival outcomes as well as binary or continuous outcomes measured at the end of follow-up.

We evaluate race differences in the processes that link poverty and single parenthood to antisocial behavior, drawing on conceptual models that link structural conditions to children's well-being through the mediating influences of parental distress and unsupportive parenting. On the basis of data from the 1988 Children of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth data set, we find that the total effects of poverty and single parenthood on parenting practices, and of parenting practices on antisocial behavior, do not differ significantly by race. However, the processes that create those effects do vary by race. Parenting practices and antisocial behavior are reciprocally related for whites but parenting practices do not significantly predict antisocial behavior for blacks.},

Formulae are derived for the bias of estimators when used either to estimate average treatment effect (ACE) or to estimate complier average treatment effect (CACE) under several models for the relationship between compliance and potential outcomes. These enable the expected values of AT, PP and IV estimators to be ranked in relation to ACE, and show that AT and PP estimators are generally biased for both ACE and CACE even under homogeneity. However, we show that the difference between any pair of (AT, PP, IV) estimates can be used to estimate the correlation between the latent variable determining compliance behaviour and one potential outcome. In the absence of measures that predict compliance, bounds for ACE can only be set given strong assumptions. Regarding the Intention to Treat estimator, while this is `biased towards the null' if viewed as a measure of CACE, we show that it is not always so in relation to ACE. Finally we discuss the behaviour of the estimators under weak and strong null hypotheses. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2009 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Intervention(s) The follow-up of the children was performed by questionnaires at birth and again at 1~year and at 4~years of age. Five-year-old children were invited for individual assessment. Behavioral performance was assessed with the use of the Child Behavior Checklist for parents and teachers. Cognitive performance was assessed with the use of the Dutch Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence test, 3rd version. Motor performance was assessed with the use of the Dutch Movement Assessment Battery for Children, 2nd version. Physical development was assessed by means of physical examination and medical history. Main Outcome Measure(s) Behavioral, cognitive, and motor performance and physical development. Result(s) Eighty-nine children were completely assessed, and 14 were partially assessed at the age of 5~years. The 5-year-old cohort assessed significantly better on behavioral and cognitive performance and significantly worse on motor performance\textemdash but still in the normal range\textemdash compared with the theoretic distribution in the general population. Four children (3.8\%) of the 5-year-old cohort had developmental problems/delays.

In Africa, important progress has been made in the past decade with the introduction of a preventive strategy for malaria in pregnancy consisting of intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp) and insecticide-treated nets, yet their coverage is still unacceptably low and malaria continues to demand a huge toll on pregnant women and their newborn babies. Increasing the frequency of dosing of IPTp with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine might provide temporary respite, but increasing resistance to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine makes research into safe, efficacious, and affordable alternatives for IPTp one of the  highest priorities for the control of malaria in pregnancy. A number of promising alternatives are, or will soon be, available that need to be evaluated as IPTp after their safety and pharmacokinetics in pregnancy have first been assessed in  parasitaemic women. Little is known about appropriate control strategies in Asia  and Latin America for Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax malaria in pregnancy, which in most countries rely on responsive case management approaches. The role of case management based on proactive screening for malaria infection of women attending antenatal care or preventive approaches with insecticide-treated  nets or IPTp are urgently needed. To achieve these objectives, multicentre and multidisciplinary approaches are required across the range of malaria transmission settings that include assessment of immunological effect of successful preventions, the perceptions and acceptability of different preventive approaches, and their cost-effectiveness.},

The potential role of selection bias in explaining such heterogeneity is considered within this study. Selection bias according to familial characteristics and socioeconomic status is investigated within a United Kingdom-based case-control study of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma diagnosed during 1998-2001. Reported distributions of birth order and maternal age are each compared with expected reference distributions derived using national birth statistics from the United Kingdom. A method is detailed in which yearly data are used to derive expected distributions, taking account of variability in birth statistics over time. Census data are used to reweight both the case and control study populations such that they are comparable with the general population with regard to socioeconomic status. The authors found little support for an association between non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and birth order or family size and little evidence for an influence of selection bias. However, the findings suggest that between-study heterogeneity could be explained by selection biases that influence the demographic characteristics of participants.},

The absence of random selection prompts justified concerns about self-selection producing biased results and means that traditional, design-based estimation is inappropriate. This paper seeks to provide insight into the conditions under which nonprobability surveys can be expected to provide estimates free of selection bias. In fields such as epidemiology and economics that routinely work with observational data, researchers have identified the necessary conditions for unbiased estimation of causal effects when treatments are not assigned randomly. Similar conditions apply to survey estimates when respondents are not randomly selected. Drawing on this body of research, we propose a framework composed of three elements that determine the level of selection bias in survey estimates. In this paper, we first provide a general overview of these components and demonstrate the link between causal inference and survey inference in the probability-based setting. Second, we give simplified examples to demonstrate how each of the components can contribute to bias in survey estimates. Finally, we review current practices in the area of nonprobability data collection and estimation, and specify how these methods relate to the elements identified here.},

  abstract = {The "neighborhood effects" literature, as currently constructed in epidemiology, would benefit from critical attention to the following four issues: 1) use of appropriate measurement tools and methods for neighborhood environments; 2) theoretical or conceptual guidance as to the aspects of residential environments most salient to human health (both within and across health endpoints); 3) the scale on which investigators measure neighborhood environments to best correspond to meaningful neighborhood boundaries and relevant neighborhood exposures; and 4) those selection and structural features that confound investigators' capacity to draw causal inferences from neighborhood environments to human health. In this issue of the Journal, Mujahid et al. (Am J Epidemiol 2007;165:858-867) report on the psychometric and ecometric results of their neighborhood scale testing. By providing a more rigorous approach to testing of neighborhood-attribute measurement tools, they make an important contribution to the literature. Also noteworthy is their explicit use of a conceptual model, which may facilitate the development of more meaningful area-level measures. Unfortunately, while Mujahid et al. had the capacity to consider spatially relevant measures, based on prior research and their conceptual model, they relied exclusively on aggregated census units. Hopefully, the scale issue will be addressed more thoroughly in future work. Clearly, Mujahid et al. have made progress in addressing how, and to a lesser extent what, to measure when researchers estimate neighborhood effects. But equally clearly, important work remains to be done. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2007 by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health All rights reserved.},

Our aim was to determine whether immediate ADT extends survival in men with node-positive prostate cancer who have undergone radical prostatectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy compared with those who received ADT only once disease progressed. Methods: Eligible patients from 36 institutes in the USA were randomly assigned in 1988-93 to receive immediate ADT (n=47) or to be observed (n=51), with ADT to be given on detection of distant metastases or symptomatic recurrences. Patients were followed up every 3 months for the first year and every 6 months thereafter. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival; secondary endpoints were overall and disease-specific survival. Analysis was by intention to treat. To ensure that the treatment groups were comparable, we did a retrospective central pathology review of slides and regraded the Gleason scores for available samples. This trial predates the requirement for clinical trial registration. Findings: At median follow-up of 11{$\cdot$}9 years (range 9{$\cdot$}7-14{$\cdot$}5 for surviving patients), men assigned immediate ADT had a significant improvement in overall survival (hazard ratio 1{$\cdot$}84 [95\% CI 1{$\cdot$}01-3{$\cdot$}35], p=0{$\cdot$}04), prostate-cancer-specific survival (4{$\cdot$}09 [1{$\cdot$}76-9{$\cdot$}49], p=0{$\cdot$}0004), and progression-free survival (3{$\cdot$}42 [1{$\cdot$}96-5{$\cdot$}98], p{$<$}0{$\cdot$}0001). Of 49 histopathology slides received (19 immediate ADT, 30 observation), 16 were downgraded from the original Gleason score (between groups {$\leq$}6, 7, and {$\geq$}8) and five were upgraded. We recorded similar proportions of score changes in each group (p=0{$\cdot$}68), and no difference in score distribution by treatment (p=0{$\cdot$}38). After adjustment for score, associations were still significant between treatment and survival (overall, p=0{$\cdot$}02; disease-specific, p=0{$\cdot$}002; progression-free survival, p{$<$}0{$\cdot$}0001). Interpretation: Early ADT benefits patients with nodal metastases who have undergone prostatectomy and lymphadenectomy, compared with those who receive deferred treatment. The beneficial effects of early ADT, rather than an imbalance in risk factors, are likely to explain the differences in outcomes between treatments. \textcopyright{} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

In an attempt to understand the molecular basis for the lack of inducibility of CYP1A protein expression and activity in Elizabeth River killifish, we analyzed the expression of CYP1A and four other members of the AHR signal transduction pathway: AHR1, AHR2, AHR repressor (AHRR), and AHR nuclear translocator (ARNT). Gene expression was measured by cycle-optimized reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis of messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) extracted from livers of killifish from the Elizabeth River and King's Creek (VA, USA) (reference site), 36 h after injection with beta-naphthoflavone (BNF, an AHR agonist) or corn oil (carrier control). Hepatic CYP1A mRNA was inducible in King's Creek killifish. However, in Elizabeth River killifish, no induction of CYP1A mRNA was observed, confirming and extending previous results showing no induction of CYP1A protein or catalytic activity in this population. Similarly, AHRR and AHR2 mRNA levels were induced by BNF in King's Creek but not Elizabeth River killifish. No population or treatment-related differences were observed in expression of AHR1 or ARNT mRNAs. The results reveal in Elizabeth River killifish a consistent lack of inducibility of genes that are normally inducible by AHR agonists (CYP1A. AHRR, AHR2). However, the expression of AHR1, AHR2, and AHRR in vehicle-treated fish did not differ between Elizabeth River and King's Creek killifish, suggesting that altered constitutive expression of AHRs or AHRR does not underlie the refractory CYP1A phenotype in Elizabeth River killifish.},

Since clear supportive laboratory evidence is lacking and biophysical plausibility of carcinogenicity of MFs is questioned, a causal relationship between childhood leukaemia and magnetic field exposure is not established. Among the alternative explanations, selection bias in epidemiological studies of MFs seems to be the most plausible hypothesis. In reviewing the epidemiological literature on ELF-MF exposure and childhood leukaemia, we found evidence both for and against the existence of selection bias. To evaluate the potential for selection bias, we examined the relationship of socioeconomic status to subject participation and exposure to MFs. We find that, often, reporting of selection processes in itself is biased and incomplete, making the interpretation and evaluation of a potential for bias difficult. However, if present, such a bias would have wide implications for case-control studies in general. We call for better reporting and for evaluation of the potential for selection bias in all case-control studies, as well as, for the development of novel methods in control selection and recruitment. \textcopyright{} 2006 Oxford University Press.},

  abstract = {The authors evaluated the role of selection bias in the 1999 Canadian case-control study of residential magnetic field exposure and childhood leukemia. They included cases, participating controls, and first-choice nonparticipating controls in their analyses. Exposure was assessed by wire coding, a classification system based on the distribution line characteristics near homes. Although an imperfect measure of magnetic field exposure, wire coding is the only method applicable to nonparticipating subjects. First-choice nonparticipant controls tended to be of lower socioeconomic status than their replacements (non-first-choice participant controls), and lower socioeconomic status was related to higher wire code categories. The odds ratios for developing childhood leukemia in the highest exposure category were 1.6 (95\% confidence interval: 1.0, 2.6) when the actual participating controls were used and 1.3 (95\% confidence interval: 0.8, 2.1) when the first-choice ideal controls were used, regardless of their participation. Overall, the authors conclude that, although there is some evidence for control selection or participation bias in the Canadian study, it is unlikely to explain entirely the observed association between magnetic field exposure and childhood leukemia. Inherent problems in exposure assessment for nonparticipating subjects, however, limit the interpretations of these results, and the role of selection bias cannot entirely be dismissed on the basis of these results alone.},

Long term risk ratio can be computed through the coupling of case referent data on exposure rates for various age categories with estimates, possibly from the study itself, of the corresponding age specific incidence densities for the exposed and nonexposed combined, but again, no rarity assumption is involved. Such data also provide for the assessment of exposure specific absolute incidence rates and risks.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Lack of a non-invasive diagnostic test contributes to the long delay between onset of symptoms and diagnosis of endometriosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the combined performance of six potential plasma biomarkers in the diagnosis of endometriosis. METHODS: This case-control study was conducted in 294 infertile women, consisting of 93 women with a normal pelvis and 201 women with endometriosis. We measured plasma concentrations of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, tumour necrosis factor-alpha, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), and cancer antigens CA-125 and CA-19-9. Analyses were done using the Kruskal-Wallis test, Mann-Whitney test, receiver operator characteristic, stepwise logistic regression and least squares support vector machines (LSSVM). RESULTS: Plasma levels of IL-6, IL-8 and CA-125 were increased in all women with endometriosis and in those with minimal-mild endometriosis, compared with controls. In women with moderate-severe endometriosis, plasma levels of IL-6, IL-8 and CA-125, but also of hsCRP, were significantly higher than in controls. Using stepwise logistic regression, moderate-severe endometriosis was diagnosed with a sensitivity of 100\% (specificity 84\%) and minimal-mild endometriosis was detected with a sensitivity of 87\% (specificity 71\%) during the secretory phase. Using LSSVM analysis, minimal-mild endometriosis was diagnosed with a sensitivity of 94\% (specificity 61\%) during the secretory phase and with a sensitivity of 92\% (specificity 63\%) during the menstrual phase. CONCLUSIONS: Advanced statistical analysis of a panel of six selected plasma biomarkers on samples obtained during the secretory phase or during menstruation allows the diagnosis of both minimal-mild and moderate-severe endometriosis with high sensitivity and clinically acceptable specificity.},

References based on birthweight are deficient for preterm births, those derived from ultrasound estimates might not be applicable to all populations, and the individualised reference can be too complex to use in developing countries. Our aim was to create a generic reference for fetal weight and birthweight that overcame these deficiencies and could be readily adapted to local populations. We used the fetal-weight reference developed by Hadlock and colleagues and the notion of proportionality proposed by Gardosi and colleagues and made the weight reference easily adjustable according to the mean birthweight at 40 weeks of gestation for any local population. For application and validation, we used data from 24 countries in Africa, Latin America, and Asia that participated in the 2004-08 WHO Global Survey on Maternal and Perinatal Health (237 025 births). We compared our reference with that of Hadlock and colleagues (non-customised) and with that of Gardosi and colleagues (individualised). For every reference, the odds ratio (OR) of adverse perinatal outcomes (stillbirths, neonatal deaths, referral to higher-level or special care unit, or Apgar score lower than 7 at 5 min) for infants who were small for gestational age versus those who were not was estimated with multilevel logistic regression. OR of adverse outcomes for infants small for gestational age versus those not small for gestational age was 1{$\cdot$}59 (95 CI 1{$\cdot$}53- 1{$\cdot$}66) for the non-customised fetal-weight reference compared with 2{$\cdot$}87 (2{$\cdot$}73-3{$\cdot$}01) for our country-specific reference, and 2{$\cdot$}84 (2{$\cdot$}71-2{$\cdot$}99) for the fully individualised reference. Our generic reference for fetal-weight and birthweight percentiles can be easily adapted to local populations.

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: A previous paper used latent class analysis to assign individuals to 1 of 4 adolescent/young adult smoking trajectory classes and then established an association between maternal smoking before, during, and after pregnancy and these classes. In this paper, we examine one possible pathway for this relationship: that maternal smoking during pregnancy may set off a behavioral trajectory which increases the likelihood of problem behaviors generally, of which smoking is one manifestation. METHODS: We used the Behavior Problems Index measure from age 8 through age 12 as a potential mediator. We used a path analysis modeling approach within a multinomial logistic regression (using Mplus) to estimate direct and indirect effects (via behavioral problems) between maternal smoking pattern and child trajectory class. RESULTS: We found small but statistically significant indirect effects via behavioral problems from maternal smoking to child smoking trajectory for membership in all 3 smoking classes, relative to the nonsmoking trajectory, indicating partial mediation. Mediated effects were associated with maternal smoking after pregnancy, no statistically significant mediated effects were found for smoking before or during pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: The results provided no evidence that the effects of maternal smoking during pregnancy on child smoking trajectory are mediated by problem behavior. Effects from smoking after birth to child smoking trajectory appear to be partially mediated by problem behavior, supporting a behavioral rather than physiological effect of smoking during pregnancy but not ruling out more complex physiological pathways.},

  abstract = {Path-specific effects constitute a broad class of mediated effects from an exposure to an outcome via one or more causal pathways along a set of intermediate variables. Most of the literature concerning estimation of mediated effects has focused on parametric models, with stringent assumptions regarding unmeasured confounding. We consider semiparametric inference of a path-specific effect when these assumptions are relaxed. In particular, we develop a suite of semiparametric estimators for the effect along a pathway through a mediator, but not through an exposure-induced confounder of that mediator. These estimators have different robustness properties, as each depends on different parts of the likelihood of the observed data. One estimator is locally semiparametric efficient and multiply robust. The latter property implies that machine learning can be used to estimate nuisance functions.We demonstrate these properties, as well as finite-sample properties of all the estimators, in a simulation study. We apply our method to an HIV study, in which we estimate the effect comparing two drug treatments on a patient's average log CD4 count mediated by the patient's level of adherence, but not by previous experience of toxicity, which is clearly affected by which treatment the patient is assigned to and may confound the effect of the patient's level of adherence on their virologic outcome.},

This study assesses the implications of this phenomenon for inequality in educational attainment. A proper account of educational trajectories requires simultaneous consideration of qualitatively different types of destinations within educational transitions, of the timing at which different transitions occur, and of the sequence of events within educational levels. To examine "traditional" and "non-traditional" pathways through post-secondary education, this study relies on detailed educational histories from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979-2002. Findings reveal that deviations from a traditional trajectory are widespread, are more frequent among students who enrolled in less selective colleges, and also among socioeconomically and academically disadvantaged students. Results show that following a "non-traditional" pathway reduces students' chances to enroll in college and to complete a post-secondary degree. In the case of bachelor's degree completion, most of the observed gap among students from different socioeconomic backgrounds is accounted for the different trajectories students follow. This study demonstrates that a fine-grained analysis of students' trajectories improves our understanding of the persistent socioeconomic disparities in educational attainment. \textcopyright{} 2010 International Sociological Association Research Committee 28 on Social Stratification and Mobility.},

  abstract = {Objective: We sought to determine the risk of lymphedema associated with immediate breast reconstruction compared to mastectomy alone. Background: Immediate breast reconstruction is increasingly performed at the time of mastectomy. Few studies have examined whether breast reconstruction impacts development of lymphedema. Methods: A total of 616 patients with breast cancer who underwent 891 mastectomies between 2005 and 2013 were prospectively screened for lymphedema at our institution, with 22.2 months' median follow-up. Mastectomies were categorized as immediate implant, immediate autologous, or no reconstruction. Arm measurements were performed preoperatively and during postoperative follow-up using a Perometer. Lymphedema was defined as 10\% or more arm volume increase compared to preoperative. KaplanMeier and Cox regression analyses were performed to determine lymphedema rates and risk factors. Results: Of 891 mastectomies, 65\% (580/891) had immediate implant, 11\% (101/891) immediate autologous, and 24\% (210/891) no reconstruction. The two-year cumulative incidence of lymphedema was as follows: 4.08\% [95\% confidence interval (CI): 2.59\textendash 6.41\%] implant, 9.89\% (95\% CI: 4.98\textendash 19.1\%) autologous, and 26.7\% (95\% CI: 20.4\textendash 34.4\%) no reconstruction. By multivariate analysis, immediate implant [hazards ratio (HR): 0.352, P {$<$} 0.0001] but not autologous (HR: 0.706, P {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.2151) reconstruction was associated with a significantly reduced risk of lymphedema compared to no reconstruction. Axillary lymph node dissection (P {$<$} 0.0001), higher body mass index (P {$<$} 0.0001), and greater number of nodes dissected (P {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.0324) were associated with increased lymphedema risk. Conclusions: This prospective study suggests that in patients for whom implant-based reconstruction is available, immediate implant reconstruction does not increase the risk of lymphedema compared to mastectomy alone.},

  abstract = {Multiple imputation (MI) is a well-established method for dealing with missing data. MI is computationally intensive when imputing missing covariates with high-dimensional outcome data (e.g., DNA methylation data in epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS)), because every outcome variable must be included in the imputation model to avoid biasing associations towards the null. Instead, EWAS analyses are reduced to only complete cases, limiting statistical power and potentially causing bias. We used simulations to compare 5 MI methods for high-dimensional data under 2 missingness mechanisms. All imputation methods had increased power over complete-case (C-C) analyses. Imputing missing values separately for each variable was computationally inefficient, but dividing sites at random into evenly sized bins improved efficiency and gave low bias. Methods imputing solely using subsets of sites identified by the C-C analysis suffered from bias towards the null. However, if these subsets were added into random bins of sites, this bias was reduced. The optimal methods were applied to an EWAS with missingness in covariates. All methods identified additional sites over the C-C analysis, and many of these sites had been replicated in other studies. These methods are also applicable to other high-dimensional data sets, including the rapidly expanding area of "-omics" studies.},

In the work reported here, we followed 464 14- to 18-year-old American Indian youth annually for seven years. We examined the development of alcohol use and positive alcohol outcome expectancies in parallel, using growth mixture modeling to identify classes with different trajectories of alcohol use and expectancies. We found five classes; the largest (n = 198) was made up of youth who experienced increases in both alcohol use and positive outcome expectancies. Initial levels of outcome expectancies were related to subsequent changes in alcohol use, while the reverse was not true, suggesting that interventions focusing on outcome expectancies are appropriate for a substantial number of youth. However, class heterogeneity in the relationships between the two processes pointed out that changes in expectancies may not always precede changes in alcohol use. Thus, intervention design implications are discussed for the class structures.},

  abstract = {STUDY QUESTION: Does inverse probability weighting (IPW) provide a more valid estimate of the cumulative incidence of live birth after multiple cycles of IVF? SUMMARY ANSWER: IPW can provide a more accurate estimate of treatment success for counseling and decision-making regarding IVF. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Different approaches have been used to define and calculate IVF success; however, many of these approaches have limitations and potentially violate statistical assumptions. IPW can address potential selection bias that arises when people do not continue IVF treatment after a failed cycle. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Data were derived from a cohort study of women undergoing their first fresh embryo transfer IVF cycle at our institution between 1 January 1995 and 31 December 2014. All autologous cycles (fresh and frozen) were included, up to six total cycles. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: We identified 20 015 women who underwent 47 079 IVF cycles and had 10 031 live births during the study period. The cumulative incidence of live birth was calculated using three approaches. First, we used a standard Kaplan-Meier approach, 'the optimistic approach', censoring women when they dropped out of treatment. Second, we used a 'conservative' Kaplan-Meier approach that assumed women who dropped out of treatment did not achieve a live birth. Finally, we used IPW to calculate the probability of remaining in treatment, while accounting for differences in treatment drop out. IPW up-weights the data of those remaining under observation who resembled the women who dropped out of treatment, thereby decreasing the potential selection bias resulting from loss to follow-up. The IPW was incorporated into a Kaplan-Meier approach. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: The cumulative incidence of live birth was 72.1\% (95\% CI: 71.0-73.1\%) for the optimistic approach, 50.1\% (49.4-50.8\%) for the conservative approach and 66.8\% (65.5-68.1\%) for the IPW approach. Among women {$<$} 38 years of age, the cumulative incidence of live birth calculated by the IPW was slightly higher than that calculated by the optimistic approach. For women 41-42 years of age, the IPW cumulative incidence of live birth was slightly lower. The IPW was similar to the optimistic approach for the other age groups. The conservative estimate was lowest for all age groups. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Only clinical data recorded by the providers during an IVF cycle were used to generate weights for IPW. Covariates included: age, gravidity and year at the start of the cycle; primary infertility diagnosis; procedure type (i.e. whether a fresh or frozen embryo was transferred); number of mature oocytes retrieved; number of embryos transferred; cycle cancellation; pregnancy loss in the cycle; and insurance status. We were unable to determine exact reasons for treatment drop out (e.g. cessation of IVF treatment, transfer to another institution or spontaneous pregnancy). Our IPW model was moderately predictive based on the c-statistic from the calculation of the denominator of the weight; however, residual selection bias may remain due to the limited range of covariate data. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: IPW can be used in a variety of settings to address selection bias introduced by differential loss to follow up or treatment drop out.

Setting and Patient(s): Twenty-three studies comparing serum CA-125 levels and laparoscopically confirmed endometriosis. Intervention(s): Serum CA-125 measurement and laparoscopy. Main Outcome Measure(s): Sensitivity and specificity of serum CA-125 measurement in the diagnosis of endometriosis with laparoscopy as the reference standard. Result(s): The estimated summary receiver operating characteristic curves showed that the performance of serum CA-125 measurement in the diagnosis of endometriosis grade I/IV is limited, whereas its performance in the diagnosis of endometriosis grade HI/IV is better. Conclusion(s): Despite its limited diagnostic performance, we believe that the routine use of serum CA-125 measurement in patients with infertility might be justified. In contrast to laparoscopy, serum CA-125 measurement is an inexpensive test that is not a burden for the patient. It could identify a subgroup of patients who are more likely to benefit from early laparoscopy. Studies reporting on the mutual dependence between serum CA-125 measurement and data from the history and physical examination are needed.},

We applied a probabilistic multiple-bias model to address possible biases simultaneously, using validation data frombilling records and nonparticipant questionnaires as information on recall error and selective participation. In our modeling, we sought to adjust for these sources of uncertainty and to facilitate interpretation. For glioma, when comparing those in the highest quartile of use ({$>$}558 lifetime hours) to those who were not regular users, the odds ratio was 2.0 (95\%confidence interval: 1.2, 3.4). After adjustment for selection and recall biases, the odds ratio was 2.2 (95\% limits: 1.3, 4.1). There was little evidence of an increase in the risk of meningioma, acoustic neuroma, or parotid gland tumors in relation to mobile phone use.

Method comparison studies revealed large differences for some individual samples. Overall slopes ranged from 0.50 to 1.48, and correlation coefficients were 0.90 to 0.96 when the ADVIA Centaur was the comparison method. The 97.5 percentile upper reference limit ranged from 23.3 to 51.7 kU/L. Additional standardization efforts are needed, and the availability of reference material is required.

Over the last decades, alternative methods have been proposed that can infer causal relations between variables from certain statistical patterns in purely observational data. We introduce Joint Causal Inference (JCI), a novel approach to causal discovery from multiple data sets from different contexts that elegantly unifies both approaches. JCI is a causal modeling framework rather than a specific algorithm, and it can be implemented using any causal discovery algorithm that can take into account certain background knowledge. JCI can deal with different types of interventions (e.g., perfect, imperfect, stochastic, etc.) in a unified fashion, and does not require knowledge of intervention targets or types in case of interventional data. We explain how several well-known causal discovery algorithms can be seen as addressing special cases of the JCI framework, and we also propose novel implementations that extend existing causal discovery methods for purely observational data to the JCI setting. We evaluate different JCI implementations on synthetic data and on flow cytometry protein expression data and conclude that JCI implementations can considerably outperform state-of-the-art causal discovery algorithms.},

While such datasets offer dramatically increased statistical power compared with conventional primary data collection, typically at much lower cost, their use also raises substantial inferential challenges. In particular, it can be difficult to make population inferences because the sampling frames for many administrative datasets are undefined. We reviewed options for accounting for sampling in big data epidemiology. Recent Findings We identified three common strategies for accounting for sampling when the data available were not collected from a deliberately constructed sample: (1) explicitly reconstruct the sampling frame, (2) test the potential impacts of sampling using sensitivity analyses, and (3) limit inference to sample. Summary Inference from big data can be challenging because the impacts of sampling are unclear. Attention to sampling frames can minimize risks of bias.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Research over the past decade has suggested that prenatal and early postnatal nutrition influence the risk of developing chronic degenerative diseases up to 60 years later. We now present evidence that risk of death from infectious diseases in young adulthood is similarly programmed by early life events. METHODS: In three rural Gambian villages, affected by a marked annual seasonality in diet and disease, we have kept detailed demographic, anthropometric and health records since 1949. Fate was known with certainty for 3,162 individuals (2,059 alive/1,103 dead, most dying in childhood). For this case-control analysis of antecedent predictors of premature mortality, all adult deaths (n = 61) were paired with two randomly selected controls matched for sex and year of birth. RESULTS: Mean age at death was 25 (SD: 8) years. Adult death was associated with a profound bias in month of birth with 49 cases born in the nutritionally-debilitating hungry season (Jul-Dec) versus 12 in the harvest season (Jan-Jun). Relative to harvest season the hazard ratio for early death in hungry-season births rose from 3.7 (for deaths {$>$}14.5 years, P = 0.000013) to 10.3 (for deaths {$>$}25 years, P = 0.00002). Anthropometric and haematological status at 18 months of age was identical in cases and controls, indicating an earlier origin to the defect. Most deaths for which cause was known had a definite or possible infectious aetiology; none were from degenerative diseases of affluence. CONCLUSIONS: Early life exposures, correlated with season of birth, strongly influence susceptibility to fatal infections in young adulthood. The evidence suggests that nutritionally-mediated intrauterine growth retardation may permanently impair the development of immune function.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Analysis of data from rural Gambia has previously shown that being born during the annual hungry season strongly influences susceptibility to mortality from infectious disease in young adulthood, possibly through an influence on immune function. In rural Bangladesh pregnancies are exposed to similar seasonality. The current paper uses data from a large demographic survey in the Matlab region of Bangladesh to retest the Gambian-derived hypothesis that early life exposures correlated with season of birth predict later patterns of mortality. METHODS: Since 1966, a continuous demographic surveillance system has been in operation in the rural Matlab region of Bangladesh. The current analysis is based on 172 228 births and 24 697 deaths between 1974 and 2000. Season of birth was defined as 'harvest' (January-June) and 'hungry' (July-December), based on monthly variations in rates of conception and neonatal mortality within the same dataset. RESULTS: Birth during the hungry season resulted in excess mortality during the first year of life. However, for adult mortality (deaths {$>$}15 years), there was no excess in individuals born during the annual hungry season: ratio of hazard July-December versus January-June = 1.12; 95\% CI: 0.87, 1.45. CONCLUSIONS: The current study found no excess mortality in young adults born during the 'hungry' season in rural Bangladesh. This differing pattern in survival when compared with The Gambia may be a consequence of the greatly reduced incidence of young adult deaths in Bangladesh (0.1\%) compared with The Gambia (3\%). Under such conditions possible differences in immune function may not be detectable with early adult death as the outcome. However, it also remains possible that our Gambian observation could be a highly discrete phenomenon localized in either time or place, and as such, will not be replicated in other populations.},

  abstract = {In the mid-19th century, the German hygienist Max von Pettenkofer viewed cholera as resulting from the interaction between a postulated cholera germ and the characteristics of soils. In order to cause cholera, the cholera germ had to become a cholera miasma, but this transformation required prolonged contact of the germ with dry and porous soils when groundwater levels were low. This hypothetical germ-environment interaction explained more observations than did contagion alone. Despite its attraction, von Pettenkofer's postulate also implied that cholera-patient quarantine or water filtration was useless to prevent and/or control cholera epidemics. The disastrous consequences of the lack of water filtration during the massive outbreak of cholera in the German town of Hamburg in 1892 tarnished von Pettenkofer's reputation and marked thereafter the course of his life. von Pettenkofer's complex mode of thinking sank into oblivion even though, in hindsight, germ-environment interactions are more appropriate than is bacteriology alone for explaining the occurrence of cholera epidemics in populations. Revisiting the fate of von Pettenkofer's theory with modern lenses can benefit today's quest for deciphering the causes of complex associations. \textcopyright{} The Author 2007.

While the need to assess the plausibility of MAR and to perform sensitivity analyses considering ``missing not at random'' (MNAR) scenarios has been emphasized, the practical difficulty of these tasks is rarely acknowledged. With multivariable missingness, what MAR means is difficult to grasp, and in many MNAR scenarios unbiased estimation is possible using methods commonly associated with MAR. Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) have been proposed as an alternative framework for specifying practically accessible assumptions beyond the MAR-MNAR dichotomy. However, there is currently no general algorithm for deciding how to handle the missing data given a specific DAG. Here we construct ``canonical'' DAGs capturing typical missingness mechanisms in epidemiologic studies with incomplete data on exposure, outcome, and confounding factors. For each DAG, we determine whether common target parameters are ``recoverable,'' meaning that they can be expressed as functions of the available data distribution and thus estimated consistently, or whether sensitivity analyses are necessary. We investigate the performance of available-case and multiple-imputation procedures. Using data from waves 1\textendash 3 of the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (2004\textendash 2008), we illustrate how our findings can guide the treatment of missing data in point-exposure studies.},

We aim to provide insight into the interpretation of these effects, particularly by describing randomized controlled trials that could hypothetically be conducted to estimate them. In contrast with natural effects, which are defined in terms of individual-level interventions, the definitions of interventional effects rely on population-level interventions. This distinction underpins the previously described advantages of interventional effects, and reflects a shift from individual effects to more tangible population-average effects. We discuss the conceptual and practical implications for the conduct of mediation analysis. See video abstract at, http://links.lww.com/EDE/B383.},

  abstract = {Many epidemiological questions concern potential interventions to alter the pathways presumed to mediate an association. For example, we consider a study that investigates the benefit of interventions in young adulthood for ameliorating the poorer mid-life psychosocial outcomes of adolescent self-harmers relative to their healthy peers. Two methodological challenges arise. Firstly, mediation methods have hitherto mostly focused on the elusive task of discovering pathways, rather than on the evaluation of mediator interventions. Secondly, the complexity of such questions is invariably such that there are no existing data on well-defined interventions (i.e. actual treatments, programs, etc.) capturing the populations, outcomes and time-spans of interest. Instead, researchers must rely on exposure (non-intervention) data to address these questions, such as self-reported substance use and employment. We address the resulting challenges by specifying a target trial addressing three policy-relevant questions, regarding the impacts of hypothetical (rather than actual) interventions that would shift the mediators' distributions (separately, jointly or sequentially) to user-specified distributions that can be emulated with the observed data. We then define novel interventional effects that map to this trial, emulating shifts by setting mediators to random draws from those distributions. We show that estimation using a g-computation method is possible under an expanded set of causal assumptions relative to inference with well-defined interventions. These expanded assumptions reflect the lower level of evidence that is inevitable with ill-defined interventions. Application to the self-harm example using data from the Victorian Adolescent Health Cohort Study illustrates the value of our proposal for informing the design and evaluation of actual interventions in the future.},

This tutorial outlines the rationale for using simulation studies and offers guidance for design, execution, analysis, reporting and presentation. In particular, this tutorial provides: a structured approach for planning and reporting simulation studies, which involves defining aims, data-generating mechanisms, estimands, methods and performance measures ('ADEMP'); coherent terminology for simulation studies; guidance on coding simulation studies; a critical discussion of key performance measures and their estimation; guidance on structuring tabular and graphical presentation of results; and new graphical presentations.

But my paper is not intended as a review of the literature, only as a survey of one set of ideas about estimation in the analysis of contingency tables.

Our objective was to validate algorithms that detect which patients have true PSE. Methods: We linked electronic health records (EHR) to Medicare claims from a Medicare Pioneer Accountable Care Organization (ACO) to identify PSE. A neurologist reviewed 01/2012-12/2014 EHR data from a stratified sample of Medicare patients aged 65+ years to adjudicate a reference-standard to develop an algorithm for identifying patients with PSE. Patient sampling strata included those with: A) epilepsy-related claims diagnosis (n = 534 [all]); B) no diagnosis but neurologist visit (n = 500 [randomly sampled from 4346]); C) all others (n = 500 [randomly sampled from 16,065]). We reconstructed the full sample using inverse probability sampling weights; then used half to derive algorithms and assess performance, and the remainder to confirm performance. We evaluated predictive performance across several measures, e.g., specificity, sensitivity, negative and positive predictive values (NPV, PPV). We selected our best performing algorithms based on the greatest specificity and sensitivity. Results: Of 20,943 patients in the reconstructed sample, 13.6\% of patients with epilepsy had reference-standard PSE diagnosis, which represents a 3-year overall prevalence of 0.28\% or 28/10,000, and a prevalence within the subpopulation with stroke of 3\%. The best algorithm included three conditions: (a) at least one cerebrovascular claim AND one epilepsy-specific anticonvulsant OR (b) at least one cerebrovascular claim AND one electroencephalography claim (specificity 100.0\% [95\% CI 99.9\%\textendash 100.0\%], NPV 98.8\% [98.6\%\textendash 99.0\%], sensitivity 20.6\% [95\% CI 14.6\%\textendash 27.9\%], PPV 86.5\% [95\% CI 71.2\%\textendash 95.5\%]).

Results: Of 20,945 patients in the reconstructed sample, 2.1\% had confirmed epilepsy. The best-performing prediction model to identify prevalent epilepsy required epilepsy diagnoses with multiple claims at least 60 days apart, and epilepsy-specific drug claims: AUROC=0.93 [95\% confidence interval (CI), 0.90-0.96], and with an 80\% diagnostic threshold, sensitivity=87.8\% (95\% CI, 80.4\%-93.2\%), specificity=98.4\% (95\% CI, 98.2\%-98.5\%).

METHOD: Comprehensive analysis of out-of-pocket expenditure on health care through a descriptive analysis and a second, multivariate analysis using the Tobit model with emphasis on malaria, based on 800 urban and rural households in Nouna health district. RESULTS: Households will spend less on malaria, either in or outside the health facility, if given the choice to do so, because they feel confident to self-treat malaria. Seeking health care from a qualified health worker incurs more out-of-pocket expenditure than self-treatment and traditional healers, and if necessary, households sell off assets to offset the expenditure. More than 80\% of household out-of-pocket expenditure is allocated to drugs. CONCLUSION: This has policy implications for malaria control and the Roll Back Malaria Initiative. Communities need to be educated on the risks of malaria complications and the potential risk of inappropriate diagnosis and treatment. Drug or health services pricing policy needs to create an incentive to use the health services. In the fight against malaria, building alliances between households, traditional healers and health workers is essential.},

Infertile women had statistically significant higher body mass index (BMI), increased total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and triglycerides (TG) compared with fertile women. Fasting glucose, fasting insulin, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and mean arterial pressure were not found to be different between fertile and infertile women. A subgroup analysis revealed that TC, fasting glucose and fasting insulin were increased, and high-density lipoprotein was decreased only in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome compared with fertile women, whereas BMI, TG and LDL-C were statistically significantly increased in women with any indication of infertility compared with fertile women. Conclusions: Infertile women have a higher level of cardio-metabolic risk factors compared with fertile women. This finding has clinical implications for infertile women in general, and those attempting to conceive through medically assisted reproduction. Tweetable abstract: Infertile women appear to have a higher level of cardio-metabolic risk factors compared with fertile women.},

  abstract = {Large-scale cross-sectional and cohort studies have transformed our understanding of the genetic and environmental determinants of health outcomes. However, the representativeness of these samples may be limited-either through selection into studies, or by attrition from studies over time. Here we explore the potential impact of this selection bias on results obtained from these studies, from the perspective that this amounts to conditioning on a collider (i.e. a form of collider bias). Whereas it is acknowledged that selection bias will have a strong effect on representativeness and prevalence estimates, it is often assumed that it should not have a strong impact on estimates of associations. We argue that because selection can induce collider bias (which occurs when two variables independently influence a third variable, and that third variable is conditioned upon), selection can lead to substantially biased estimates of associations. In particular, selection related to phenotypes can bias associations with genetic variants associated with those phenotypes. In simulations, we show that even modest influences on selection into, or attrition from, a study can generate biased and potentially misleading estimates of both phenotypic and genotypic associations. Our results highlight the value of knowing which population your study sample is representative of. If the factors influencing selection and attrition are known, they can be adjusted for. For example, having DNA available on most participants in a birth cohort study offers the possibility of investigating the extent to which polygenic scores predict subsequent participation, which in turn would enable sensitivity analyses of the extent to which bias might distort estimates.},

We previously demonstrated that adherence adjustment can be validly conducted in the Coronary Drug Project using a simplistic approach. Here, we re-analyze the data using an approach that takes full advantage of recent methodological developments. We used inverse-probability weighted hazards models to estimate the 5-year survival and mortality risk when individuals in the placebo arm of the Coronary Drug Project adhere to at least 80\% of the drug continuously or never during the 5-year follow-up period. Adjustment for post-randomization covariates resulted in 5-year mortality risk difference estimates ranging from -\,0.7 (95\% confidence intervals (CI), -\,12.2, 10.7) to 4.5 (95\% CI, -\,6.3, 15.3) percentage points. Our analysis confirms that appropriate adjustment for post-randomization predictors of adherence largely removes the association between adherence to placebo and mortality originally described in this trial.

Multivariate generalized estimating equation for repeated binary data was used to estimate the relative risk and 95\% confidence intervals of nonadherence. RESULTS: Nonadherence was significantly greater among patients with high CD4 counts, high body mass indices, males, younger patients, patients with longer durations on ART, and those with perceived low social support. CONCLUSIONS: Targeted interventions should be developed to improve ART adherence among healthier, younger, and more experienced patients who are on ART for longer durations within HIV care and treatment programs. Social support for patients on ART should be emphasized.},

Examples include classification and regression problems, and estimating treatment effects in randomized trials or observational data. The issue of fairness arises in such problems where some covariates or treatments are "sensitive," in the sense of having potential of creating discrimination. In this paper, we argue that the presence of discrimination can be formalized in a sensible way as the presence of an effect of a sensitive covariate on the outcome along certain causal pathways, a view which generalizes (Pearl, 2009). A fair outcome model can then be learned by solving a constrained optimization problem. We discuss a number of complications that arise in classical statistical inference due to this view and provide workarounds based on recent work in causal and semi-parametric inference.},

METHODS A cross-sectional descriptive survey was conducted among 100 school children aged 8 to 10 years, living in Kutch District, Gujarat, India during July 2012. Mundra (2.4 to 3.5 mg/L) and Bhuj (0.5mg/L) were the two villages randomly selected to represent the high and low water fluoride areas respectively. Seguin Form Board Test was used to assess the intelligence quotient (IQ) level of children. Descriptive statistics and independent sample t-test was used for analysis. RESULTS Mean scores for average, shortest and total timing category were found to be significantly higher (P{$<$}0.05) among children living in Mundra (30.45{$\pm$}4.97) than those living in Bhuj (23.20{$\pm$}6.21). Mean differences at 95\% confidence interval for these timings were found to be 7.24, 7.28 and 21.78 respectively. In both the villages, females had lower mean timing scores than males but the difference was not statistically significant (P{$>$}0.05).

This study evaluates the effects of a community-based approach of PS and FS on growth and development of severely malnourished children.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nSUBJECTS/METHODS: Severely underweight hospitalised children aged 6-24 months (n = 507) were randomly allocated on discharge to five groups: (i) PS, (ii) FS, (iii) PS+FS, (iv) clinic-control and (v) hospital-control. PS included play sessions and parental counselling on child development. This was done at each fortnightly follow-up visit, that is, every second week, for 6 months at community clinics. FS included distribution of cereal-based food packets (150-300 kcal/day) for 3 months. All groups received medical care, micronutrient supplementation, health-education and growth monitoring. Children's development was assessed using revised version of Bayley Scales of Infant Development at baseline and after 3 and 6 months of intervention. Anthropometry was measured using standard procedure.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nRESULTS: Comparing groups with any stimulation with those with no stimulation there was a significant effect of stimulation on children's mental development index (group*session interaction P = 0.037, effect size = 0.37 s.d.) and weight-for-age Z-score (group*session interaction P = 0.02, effect size=0.26 s.d.). Poor levels of development and nutritional status were sustained, however, due to their initial very severe malnutrition. There was no effect on motor development and linear growth.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSION: Children receiving any stimulation showed a significant benefit to mental development and growth in weight. More intensive intervention with longer duration is needed to correct their poor developmental levels and nutritional status.},

The interpregnancy interval (IPI), defined as the time between the date of a previous birth and the conception date of the index pregnancy, may mediate this relationship. We estimated controlled direct effects to assess whether hypothetical interventions designed to increase IPIs would reduce the educational disparity in PTD. We introduce a technique for estimating controlled direct effects under interventions that set only some persons in the population to a specific mediator value. We used data from 847,618 singleton livebirths occurring in Quebec, Canada, between 1989 and 2010. Compared with mothers with some university education ({$\geq$}14 years), mothers with less than high school ({$<$}11 years), high school (11 years), and some college (12-13 years) had excess PTD risks of 2.6\% (95\% confidence interval (CI): 2.4, 2.8), 1.5\% (95\% CI: 1.4, 1.7), and 1.0\% (95\% CI: 0.9, 1.1), respectively. Risk differences under an intervention corresponding to the Healthy People 2020 objective of reducing the number of mothers with IPIs less than 18 months by 3\% were no different from those for the total relationship. Our results suggest that interventions designed to increase the length of short IPIs will yield no important change in the PTD disparity by maternal educational level.},

However, there is a longstanding debate on whether such effects are relevant targets of inference in population health. In light of the repeated calls for a more pragmatic and consequential epidemiology, we review three issues often raised in this debate: (i) the use of composite cross-world counterfactuals and the need for cross-world independence assumptions; (ii) interventional vs non-interventional identifiability; and (iii) the interpretational ambiguity of natural direct and indirect effect estimates. We use potential outcomes notation and directed acyclic graphs to explain 'cross-world' assumptions, illustrate implications of this assumption via regression models and discuss ensuing issues of interpretation. We argue that the debate on the relevance of natural direct and indirect effects rests on whether one takes as a target of inference the mathematical object per se, or the change in the world that the mathematical object represents. We further note that public health questions may be better served by estimating controlled direct effects.},

G-estimation of a structural nested model provides consistent exposure effect estimates under this bias. Methods: We estimated the effect of cumulative asbestos exposure on lung cancer mortality in a cohort comprising 2564 textile factory workers who were followed from January 1940 to December 2001. Results: At entry, median age was 23 years, with 42\% of the cohort being women and 20\% nonwhite. During the follow-up period, 15\% of person-years were classified as occurring while employed and 13\% as occupationally exposed to asbestos. For a 100 fiber-year/ml increase in cumulative asbestos, a Weibull model adjusting for sex, race, birth year, baseline exposure, and age at study entry yielded a survival time ratio of 0.88 (95\% confidence interval = 0.83 to 0.93). Further adjustment for work status yielded no practical change. The corresponding survival time ratio obtained using g-estimation of a structural nested model was 0.57 (0.33 to 0.96). Conclusions: Accounting for the healthy-worker survivor bias resulted in a 35\% stronger effect estimate. However, this estimate was considerably less precise. When healthy-worker survivor bias is suspected, methods that account for it should be used.},

  abstract = {Social epidemiologists often seek to determine the mechanisms that underlie health disparities. This work is typically based on mediation procedures that may not be justified with exposures of common interest in social epidemiology. In this analysis, we explored the consequences of using standard approaches, referred to as the difference and generalized product methods, when mediator-outcome confounders are associated with the exposure. We compared these with inverse probability-weighted marginal structural models, the structural transformation method, doubly robust g-estimation of a structural nested model, and doubly robust targeted minimum loss-based estimation. We used data on 900,726 births from 2003 to 2007 in the Penn Moms study, conducted in Pennsylvania, to assess the extent to which breastfeeding prior to hospital discharge explained the racial disparity in infant mortality. Overall, for every 1,000 births, 3.36 more infant deaths occurred among non-Hispanic black women relative to all other women (95\% confidence interval: 2.78, 3.93). Using the difference and generalized product methods to assess the disparity that would remain if everyone breastfed prior to discharge suggested a complete elimination of the disparity (risk difference = -0.87 per 1,000 births; 95\% confidence interval: -1.39, -0.35). In contrast, doubly robust methods suggested a reduction in the disparity to 2.45 (95\% confidence interval: 2.20, 2.71) more infant deaths per 1,000 births among non-Hispanic black women. Standard approaches for mediation analysis in health disparities research can yield misleading results.},

We evaluated the accuracy of record linkage approaches using the Controlled Substance Monitoring Database (Tennessee's [TN] PDMP, 2012\textendash 2016) and mortality data on all drug overdose decedents in Tennessee (2013\textendash 2016). Methods: We compared total, missed, and false positive (FP) matches (with manual verification of all FPs) across approaches that included a variety of data cleaning and matching methods (probabilistic/fuzzy vs. deterministic) for patient and death linkages, and prescription history. We evaluated the influence of linkage approaches on key prescription measures used in public health analyses. We evaluated characteristics (e.g., age, education, sex) of missed matches and incorrect matches to consider potential bias. Results: The most accurate probabilistic/fuzzy matching approach identified 4,714 overdose deaths (vs. the deterministic approach, n = 4,572), with a low FP linkage error ({$<$}1\%) and high correct match proportion (95\% vs. 92\% and \textasciitilde 90\% for probabilistic approaches not using comprehensive data cleaning). Estimation of all prescription measures improved (vs. deterministic approach). For example, frequency (\%) of decedents filling an oxycodone prescription in the last 60 days (n = 1,371 [32\%] vs. n = 1,443 [33\%]). Missed overdose decedents were more likely to be younger, male, nonwhite, and of higher education. Conclusion: Implications of study findings include underreporting, prescribing and outcome misclassification, and reduced generalizability to population risk groups, information of importance to epidemiologists and researchers using PDMP data.},

We used survey regression procedures to analyze data from the first wave of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. Degree of overweight was indicated by body mass index (BMI), which we calculated using self-reported height and weight information, whereas depressive symptoms were assessed with the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). Data were analyzed to determine (a) the social groups in which being overweight was least common, (b) the association between overweight status and depressive symptoms, and (c) potential mediators of the association between relative weight and symptoms of depression, including dieting and self-rated health. The analytic sample contained 18,924 adolescents aged 11 to 21 years (mean age was 15.68). Approximately half the sample consisted of females (n = 9634). Adjusting for exercise and sociodemographic characteristics, we found that relative weight was associated with depressive symptoms for girls but not boys. For both, the association between overweight status and symptoms of depression was stronger among adolescents in lower grades. Dieting explained the positive association between relative weight and depressive symptoms for girls, whereas self-rated health mediated the association between relative weight and symptoms of depression for adolescents in lower grades. To fully understand both the physical and mental health consequences of adolescent obesity, the social dimension of weight must be examined. \textcopyright{} 2005 Society for Adolescent Medicine.

We hypothesized that low maternal body mass index (BMI) would predict worse neurodevelopmental status in children, while higher maternal BMIs would be associated with better neurodevelopmental outcomes. METHODS: Psychomotor tests for general intelligence and motor skills were given to 355 children at a mean age of 5.3 years. Maternal nutritional status was assessed by prepregnancy body mass index (BMI) and weight gain during pregnancy. RESULTS: Fifty-four percent of the women in this study were overweight or obese. The means of the general IQ, nonverbal and verbal ability, and Gross Motor Scales of the children were 82.1 +/- 12.6, 87.4 +/- 15.7, 80.1 +/- 10.8 and 332.3 +/- 13.2, respectively. Seventeen percent of the children had general IQ scores of less than 70. To our surprise, in multiple regression analyses, adjusting for other covariates, maternal prepregnancy BMI was a significant negative predictor of IQ (beta = - 0.25, P = 0.001) and nonverbal ability (beta = - 0.29, P = 0.02). The IQ and nonverbal scores of children of women who were obese before pregnancy were approximately 5 units lower than for children whose mothers had a normal prepregnancy BMI. The other significant predictors of IQ and nonverbal scores of the children were childcare status (beta = 3.5, P = 0.04 and beta = 0.26, P {$<$} 0.0001, respectively) and the mother's receptive language scores (beta = 5.2, P = 0.01 and beta = 0.25, P {$<$} 0.0001, respectively). CONCLUSION: This study of low-income African-American children indicates that obese women are at risk of having children with diminished intellectual ability, but not motor skills.},

A prospective study was conducted to evaluate the relationship between pregnancy outcomes, psychosocial profile, and maternal health practices. METHODS: 3,149 low-income, predominantly African-American pregnant women participated in this study. A 28-item psychosocial scale measured the constructs of negative and positive affect, self esteem, mastery, worry, and stress. Maternal health practices were assessed with 11 questions dealing with diet, exercise, and the use of preventive medical and dental services. RESULTS: A low score on either scale indicated "poor" psychosocial or health practices status. Low birth weight, preterm delivery, and intrauterine growth retardation occurred in 10.9, 10.1 and 7.3\% of the pregnant women respectively. In women with low psychosocial scores, the risk of both low birth weight and preterm delivery was 40\% higher and the mean birth weight of infants was 51 g (p =0.02) lower as compared to women with high scores. Negative affect (a measure of depression) was the only factor significantly associated with both infant birth weight (beta = -71.2, p =0.001) and low birth weight (AOR=1.4, 95\% CI = 1.1-1.7). When data were stratified by body mass index, the adverse effect of negative affect scores on birth weight and low birth weight was present only in thin women. Health practice scores were not associated with any of the pregnancy outcomes. CONCLUSION: Thin women with a poor psychosocial profile and who are depressed during pregnancy are at increased risk of giving birth to low birth weight and preterm infants.},

  abstract = {Abstract: Recently, a nonparametric marginal structural model (NPMSM) approach to Causal Inference has been proposed [Neugebauer, R., van der Laan, M., 2006. Nonparametric causal effects based on marginal structural models. J. Statist. Plann. Inference (in press), www http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/03783758 .] as an appealing practical alternative to the original parametric MSM (PMSM) approach introduced by Robins [Robins, J., 1998a. Marginal structural models. In: 1997 Proceedings of the American Statistical Association, American Statistical Association, Alexandria, VA, pp. 1\^a\texteuro ``10]. The new MSM-based causal inference methodology generalizes the concept of causal effects: the proposed nonparametric causal effects are interpreted as summary measures of the causal effects defined with PMSMs. In addition, causal inference with NPMSM does not rely on the assumed correct specification of a parametric MSM but instead defines causal effects based on a user-specified working causal model which can be willingly misspecified. The NPMSM approach was developed for studies with point treatment data or with longitudinal data where the outcome is not time-dependent (typically collected at the end of data collection). In this paper, we generalize this approach to longitudinal studies where the outcome is time-dependent, i.e. collected throughout the span of the studies, and address the subsequent estimation inconsistency which could easily arise from a hasty generalization of the algorithm for maximum likelihood estimation. More generally, we provide an overview of the multiple causal effect representations which have been developed based on MSMs in longitudinal studies.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSdA total of 58,000 adults with type 2 diabetes and A1C {$<$}7\% (53 mmol/mol) while taking two or more oral agents or basal insulin had subsequent A1C {$\geq$}7\% (53 mmol/mol) to 8.5\% (69 mmol/mol). Follow-up started on date of first A1C {$\geq$}7\% and ended on date of a specific clinical event, death, disenrollment, or study end. Glucose-control strategies were defined as first intensification of glucose-lowering therapy at A1C {$\geq$}7, {$\geq$}7.5, {$\geq$}8, or {$\geq$}8.5\% with subsequent control for treatment adherence. Logistic marginal structural models were fitted to assess the discrete-time hazards for each dynamic glucosecontrol strategy, adjusting for baseline and time-dependent confounding and selection bias through inverse probability weighting. RESULTS-After adjustment for age, sex, race/ethnicity, comorbidities, blood pressure, lipids, BMI, and other covariates, progressively more aggressive glucose-control strategies were associated with reduced onset or progression of albuminuria but not associated with significant reduction in occurrence of myocardial infarction or preserved renal function based on estimated glomerular filtration rate over 4 years of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS-In a large representative cohort of adults with type 2 diabetes, more aggressive glucose-control strategies havemixed short-term effects onmicrovascular complications and do not reduce the myocardial infarction rate over 4 years of follow-up. These findings are consistent with the results of recent clinical trials, but confirmation over longer periods of observation is needed. \textcopyright{} 2013 by the American Diabetes Association.},

  abstract = {In comparative effectiveness research (CER), often the aim is to contrast survival outcomes between exposure groups defined by time-varying interventions. With observational data, standard regression analyses (e.g., Cox modeling) cannot account for time-dependent confounders on causal pathways between exposures and outcome nor for time-dependent selection bias that may arise from informative right censoring. Inverse probability weighting (IPW) estimation to fit marginal structural models (MSMs) has commonly been applied to properly adjust for these expected sources of bias in real-world observational studies. We describe the application and performance of an alternate estimation approach in such a study. The approach is based on the recently proposed targeted learning methodology and consists in targeted minimum loss-based estimation (TMLE) with super learning (SL) within a nonparametric MSM. The evaluation is based on the analysis of electronic health record data with both IPW estimation and TMLE to contrast cumulative risks under four more or less aggressive strategies for treatment intensification in adults with type 2 diabetes already on 2+ oral agents or basal insulin. Results from randomized experiments provide a surrogate gold standard to validate confounding and selection bias adjustment. Bootstrapping is used to validate analytic estimation of standard errors. This application does the following: (1) establishes the feasibility of TMLE in real-world CER based on large healthcare databases; (2) provides evidence of proper confounding and selection bias adjustment with TMLE and SL; and (3) motivates their application for improving estimation efficiency. Claims are reinforced with a simulation study that also illustrates the double-robustness property of TMLE.},

  abstract = {The management of chronic conditions is characterized by frequent re-assessment of therapy decisions in response to the patient's changing condition over the course of the illness. Evidence most suitable to inform care thus often concerns the contrast of adaptive treatment strategies that repeatedly personalize treatment decisions over time using the latest accumulated data available from the patient's previous clinic visits such as laboratory exams (e.g., hemoglobin A1c measurements in diabetes care). The frequency at which such information is monitored implicitly defines the causal estimand that is typically evaluated in an observational or randomized study of such adaptive treatment strategies. Analytic control of monitoring with standard estimation approaches for time-varying interventions can therefore not only improve study generalizibility but also inform the optimal timing of clinical surveillance. Valid inference with these estimators requires the upholding of a positivity assumption that can hinder their applicability. To potentially weaken this requirement for monitoring control, we introduce identifiability results that will facilitate the derivation of alternate estimators of effects defined by general joint treatment and monitoring interventions in the context of time-to-event outcomes. These results are developed based on the nonparametric structural equation modeling framework using a no direct effect assumption originally introduced in a prior paper that inspired this work. The relevance and scope of the results presented here are illustrated with examples in diabetes comparative effectiveness research.},

  abstract = {Despite the recent flourishing of mediation analysis techniques, many modern approaches are difficult to implement or applicable to only a restricted range of regression models. This report provides practical guidance for implementing a new technique utilizing inverse odds ratio weighting (IORW) to estimate natural direct and indirect effects for mediation analyses. IORW takes advantage of the odds ratio's invariance property and condenses information on the odds ratio for the relationship between the exposure (treatment) and multiple mediators, conditional on covariates, by regressing exposure on mediators and covariates. The inverse of the covariate-adjusted exposure-mediator odds ratio association is used to weight the primary analytical regression of the outcome on treatment. The treatment coefficient in such a weighted regression estimates the natural direct effect of treatment on the outcome, and indirect effects are identified by subtracting direct effects from total effects. Weighting renders treatment and mediators independent, thereby deactivating indirect pathways of the mediators. This new mediation technique accommodates multiple discrete or continuous mediators. IORW is easily implemented and is appropriate for any standard regression model, including quantile regression and survival analysis. An empirical example is given using data from the Moving to Opportunity (1994-2002) experiment, testing whether neighborhood context mediated the effects of a housing voucher program on obesity. Relevant Stata code (StataCorp LP, College Station, Texas) is provided.},

  abstract = {Context Androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) is a key component of treatment for aggressive and advanced prostate cancer, but it has also been associated with adverse effects on bone, metabolic, cardiovascular, sexual, and cognitive health as well as body composition. Objective To review the current literature on the adverse effects of ADT and strategies for ameliorating harm from ADT. Evidence acquisition The Medline database (through PubMed) was searched from inception to August 1, 2013, for studies documenting the side effects of ADT and for randomized and prospective trials of interventions to mitigate those side effects. Evidence synthesis Adverse effects of ADT include decreases in bone mineral density; metabolic changes such as weight gain, decreased muscle mass, and increased insulin resistance; decreased libido and sexual dysfunction; hot flashes; gynecomastia; reduced testicle size; anemia; and fatigue. Several observational studies suggest an increased risk of diabetes and cardiovascular events, although most published studies report that ADT is not linked to greater cardiovascular mortality. Randomized trials have found value in treatments for some adverse effects including bone loss (bisphosphonates, denosumab, selective estrogen receptor modulators), markers of metabolic syndrome (exercise, diet, metformin), gynecomastia (tamoxifen, prophylactic radiation), muscle loss (resistance and aerobic exercise), and hot flashes (venlafaxine, medroxyprogesterone, cyproterone acetate, gabapentin). Conclusions ADT is often a necessary component of the treatment of aggressive prostate cancer, yet it has known harms that can impair health and quality of life. Clinicians should be aware of interventions that can help mitigate these adverse effects. Patient summary Androgen deprivation therapy is a critical component of the management of aggressive and advanced prostate cancer, but it causes adverse effects including bone loss, metabolic changes, gynecomastia, muscle loss, hot flashes, and possibly increased cardiovascular events. Clinicians should be aware of interventions that can help mitigate these adverse effects.},

If all treatment effect moderators are observed in the RCT and in a dataset representing the target population, then we can obtain an estimate for the target population ATE by adjusting for the difference in the distribution of the moderators between the two samples. This paper considers sensitivity analyses for two situations: (1) where we cannot adjust for a specific moderator V observed in the RCT because we do not observe it in the target population; and (2) where we are concerned that the treatment effect may be moderated by factors not observed even in the RCT, which we represent as a composite moderator U. In both situations, the outcome is not observed in the target population. For situation (1), we offer three sensitivity analysis methods based on (i) an outcome model, (ii) full weighting adjustment and (iii) partial weighting combined with an outcome model. For situation (2), we offer two sensitivity analyses based on (iv) a bias formula and (v) partial weighting combined with a bias formula. We apply methods (i) and (iii) to an example where the interest is to generalize from a smoking cessation RCT conducted with participants of alcohol/illicit drug use treatment programs to the target population of people who seek treatment for alcohol/illicit drug use in the US who are also cigarette smokers. In this case a treatment effect moderator is observed in the RCT but not in the target population dataset.},

If X and Y both influence, or are associated with variables that influence, a common outcome, called a collider, then conditioning on the collider (or on a variable influenced by the collider - its "child") induces a spurious association between X and Y, which is known as collider bias. Characterizing the magnitude and direction of collider bias is crucial for understanding the implications of selection bias and for adjudicating decisions about whether to control for variables that are known to be associated with both exposure and outcome but could be either confounders or colliders. Considering a class of situations where all variables are binary, and where X and Y either are, or are respectively influenced by, two marginally independent causes of a collider, we derive collider bias that results from (i) conditioning on specific levels of the collider or its child (on the covariance, risk difference, and in two cases odds ratio, scales), or (ii) linear regression adjustment for, the collider or its child. We also derive simple conditions that determine the sign of such bias.},

For example, a medical doctor may see a patient many times and, at each visit, need to choose between prescribing either an invasive or a non-invasive procedure and postponing the decision to the next visit. In this paper, we develop an "advantage doubly robust" estimator for learning such dynamic treatment rules using observational data under sequential ignorability. We prove welfare regret bounds that generalize results for doubly robust learning in the single-step setting, and show promising empirical performance in several different contexts. Our approach is practical for policy optimization, and does not need any structural (e.g., Markovian) assumptions.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to examine the degree to which children born within the "normal term" range of 37 to 41 weeks' gestation vary in terms of school achievement. METHODS: This study analyzed data from 128050 singleton births born between 37 and 41 weeks' gestation in a large US city. Data were extracted from city birth records to assess a number of obstetric, social, and economic variables, at both the individual and community levels. Birth data were then matched with public school records of standardized city-wide third-grade reading and math tests. Specifically, we assessed (1) whether children born within the normal term range of 37 to 41 weeks' gestation show differences in reading and/or math ability 8 years later as a function of gestational age, and (2) the degree to which a wide range of individual- and community-level social and biological factors mediate this effect. RESULTS: Analyses revealed that gestational age within the normal term range was significantly and positively related to reading and math scores in third grade, with achievement scores for children born at 37 and 38 weeks significantly lower than those for children born at 39, 40, or 41 weeks. This effect was independent of birth weight, as well as a number of other obstetric, social, and economic factors. CONCLUSIONS: Earlier normal term birth may be a characteristic considered by researchers, clinicians, and parents to help identify children who may be at risk for poorer school performance.},

These two forms of emotion regulation depend upon interactions between prefrontal and cingulate control systems and cortical and subcortical emotion-generative systems.

However, the visual compromise from increased incidence of refractive errors, strabismus, and cerebral vision impairment has significant impact on visual function, which also has influence on other developmental aspects including psychological and educational. In this review, the normal ocular development is discussed, aiming to exemplify the impact of early exteriorisation on one of the more naive organs of prematurity. This is then related to the incidence and visual consequences of many types of deficit, including refractive error, strabismus, and loss of visual function in preterm populations, with comparisons to term infant studies. Often these conditions are linked with causal and resultant factors being impossible to segregate, but the common factor of increased rates of all types of ophthalmic deficits demonstrates that children born prematurely are indeed premature for life.},

  abstract = {Since the identification of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) over 35 years ago, mounting evidence about the impact of maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy has prompted increased attention to the link between prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) and a constellation of developmental disabilities that are characterized by physical, cognitive, and behavioral impairments. These disabilities include a continuum of developmental disorders known as fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs). Longitudinal studies suggest that individuals with FASDs are at a greatly increased risk for adverse long-term outcomes, including mental health problems and poor social adjustment. This review summarizes the existing literature on mental health outcomes for individuals with PAE across the lifespan, including findings in infancy and early childhood, middle childhood, and adolescence and early adulthood. Research on the psychiatric disabilities suffered by individuals with FASDs throughout development highlights the need for training of mental health professionals in the identification and the provision of specific treatments to address the unique features of this developmental disability since early identification and treatment have been demonstrated to be protective against more serious secondary disabilities. It is hoped that with greater awareness of the mental health problems experienced by individuals with FASDs, these individuals can receive appropriate and early treatment resulting in more adaptive and rewarding lives.},

  abstract = {Identification of new molecular targets for the treatment of breast cancer is an important clinical goal, especially for triple-negative breast cancer, which is refractory to existing targeted treatments. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor known primarily as the mediator of dioxin toxicity. However, the AhR can also inhibit cellular proliferation in a ligand-dependent manner and act as a tumor suppressor in mice, and thus may be a potential anticancer target. To investigate the AhR as an anticancer target, we conducted a small molecule screen to discover novel AhR ligands with anticancer properties. We identified raloxifene, a selective estrogen receptor (ER) modulator currently used in the clinic for prevention of ER-positive breast cancer and osteoporosis in post-menopausal women, as an AhR activator. Raloxifene directly bound the AhR and induced apoptosis in ER-negative mouse and human hepatoma cells in an AhR-dependent manner, indicating that the AhR is a molecular target of raloxifene and mediates raloxifene-induced apoptosis in the absence of ER. Raloxifene selectively induced apoptosis of triple-negative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells compared with non-transformed mammary epithelial cells via the AhR. Combined with recent data showing that raloxifene inhibits triple-negative breast cancer xenografts in vivo (Int J Oncol. 43(3):785-92, 2013), our results support the possibility of repurposing of raloxifene as an AhR-targeted therapeutic for triple-negative breast cancer patients. To this end, we also evaluated the role of AhR expression on survival of patients diagnosed with breast cancer. We found that higher expression of the AhR is significantly associated with increased overall survival and distant metastasis-free survival in both hormone-dependent (ER-positive) and hormone-independent (ER and progesterone receptor (PR)-negative) breast cancers. Together, our data strongly support the possibility of using the AhR as a molecular target for the treatment of hormone-independent breast cancers.},

CVD risk was increased in men on GnRH agonists compared with the comparison cohort (hazard ratio [HR] of incident CVD, 1.21; 95\% CI, 1.18 to 1.25; and orchiectomy: HR, 1.16; 95\% CI, 1.08 to 1.25). Men with PCa on AA were at decreased risk (HR of incident CVD, 0.87; 95\% CI, 0.82 to 0.91). CVD risk was highest during the first 6 months of ADT in men who experienced two or more cardiovascular events before therapy, with an HR of CVD during the first 6 months of GnRH agonist therapy of 1.91 (95\% CI, 1.66 to 2.20), an HR of CVD with AA of 1.60 (95\% CI, 1.24 to 2.06), and an HR of CVD with orchiectomy of 1.79 (95\% CI, 1.16 to 2.76) versus the comparison cohort.\textbackslash nConclusion Our results support that there should be a solid indication for ADT in men with PCa so that benefit outweighs potential harm; this is of particular importance among men with a recent history of CVD.},

  abstract = {Traditionally, statistical inference and causal inference on human subjects rely on the assumption that individuals are independently affected by treatments or exposures. However, recently there has been increasing interest in settings, such as social networks, where individuals may interact with one another such that treatments may spill over from the treated individual to their social contacts and outcomes may be contagious. Existing models proposed for causal inference using observational data from networks of interacting individuals have two major shortcomings. First, they often require a level of granularity in the data that is infeasible in practice to collect in most settings and, second, the models are high dimensional and often too big to fit to the available data. We illustrate and justify a parsimonious parameterization for network data with interference and contagion. Our parameterization corresponds to a particular family of graphical models known as chain graphs. We argue that, in some settings, chain graph models approximate the marginal distribution of a snapshot of a longitudinal data-generating process on interacting units. We illustrate the use of chain graphs for causal inference about collective decision making in social networks by using data from US Supreme Court decisions between 1994 and 2004 and in simulations.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Fully understanding the determinants and sequelae of fetal growth requires a continuous measure of birth weight adjusted for gestational age. Published United States reference data, however, provide estimates only of the median and lowest and highest 5th and 10th percentiles for birth weight at each gestational age. The purpose of our analysis was to create more continuous reference measures of birth weight for gestational age for use in epidemiologic analyses. METHODS: We used data from the most recent nationwide United States Natality datasets to generate multiple reference percentiles of birth weight at each completed week of gestation from 22 through 44 weeks. Gestational age was determined from last menstrual period. We analyzed data from 6,690,717 singleton infants with recorded birth weight and sex born to United States resident mothers in 1999 and 2000. RESULTS: Birth weight rose with greater gestational age, with increasing slopes during the third trimester and a leveling off beyond 40 weeks. Boys had higher birth weights than girls, later born children higher weights than firstborns, and infants born to non-Hispanic white mothers higher birth weights than those born to non-Hispanic black mothers. These results correspond well with previously published estimates reporting limited percentiles. CONCLUSIONS: Our method provides comprehensive reference values of birth weight at 22 through 44 completed weeks of gestation, derived from broadly based nationwide data. Other approaches require assumptions of normality or of a functional relationship between gestational age and birth weight, which may not be appropriate. These data should prove useful for researchers investigating the predictors and outcomes of altered fetal growth.},

Individuals just above the threshold are expected to be similar in their distribution of measured and unmeasured baseline covariates to individuals just below the threshold, resulting in exchangeability. At the threshold exchangeability is guaranteed if there is random variation in the continuous assignment variable, e.g., due to random measurement error. Under exchangeability, causal effects can be identified at the threshold. The regression discontinuity intention-to-treat (RD-ITT) effect on an outcome can be estimated as the difference in the outcome between individuals just above (or below) versus just below (or above) the threshold. This effect is analogous to the ITT effect in a randomized controlled trial. Instrumental variable methods can be used to estimate the effect of exposure itself utilizing the threshold as the instrument. We review the recent epidemiologic literature reporting regression discontinuity studies and find that while regression discontinuity designs are beginning to be utilized in a variety of applications in epidemiology, they are still relatively rare, and analytic and reporting practices vary. Regression discontinuity has the potential to greatly contribute to the evidence base in epidemiology, in particular on the real-life and long-term effects and side-effects of medical treatments that are provided based on threshold rules - such as treatments for low birth weight, hypertension or diabetes.},

  abstract = {ISSUES: The lack of consensus about whether low to moderate levels of prenatal alcohol exposure are a risk factor for fetal development has generated considerable debate about what advice policies and guidelines should provide. APPROACH: This paper reviews the evidence from systematic reviews and meta-analyses examining the risk from low and moderate levels of prenatal alcohol exposure, along with the results of articles published 2009-2010, after the reviews. KEY FINDINGS: The reported significant effects from low levels of prenatal alcohol exposure are likely due to methodological issues such as confounding and/or misclassification of exposure or outcome and there is no strong research evidence of fetal effects from low levels of alcohol exposure. However, harm is well-documented with heavy exposure and moderate levels of exposure, 30-40 g per occasion and no more than 70 g per week, have been demonstrated to increase the risk of child behaviour problems. IMPLICATIONS: With such a small margin before there is increased risk to the fetus, it would be morally and ethically unacceptable for policies and guidelines to condone consumption of alcohol during pregnancy. Not all women will follow this advice and some women will inadvertently consume alcohol prior to pregnancy awareness requiring non-judgmental counselling and the provision of rational advice about the likelihood of risk to the fetus. CONCLUSIONS: The policy advice that 'the safest choice for pregnant women is to abstain from alcohol during pregnancy' should be maintained. However, the abstinence message needs to be presented in a balanced and rational manner to prevent unintended negative consequences.},

Methods: Fourteen thousand one hundred ten infants were enrolled in the Zimbabwe Vitamin A for Mothers and Babies trial in Zimbabwe before the availability of antiretroviral therapy or co-trimoxazole. Anthropometric measurements were taken from birth through 12-24 months of age. Growth outcomes were compared between 5 groups of children: HIV-infected in utero (IU), intrapartum (IP) or postnatally (PN); HIV-exposed uninfected (HEU); and HIV unexposed. Results: Growth failure was common across all groups of children. Compared with HIV-unexposed children, IU-, IP- and PN-infected children had significantly lower length-for-age and weight-for-length Z scores throughout the first 2 years of life. At 12 months, odds ratios for stunting were higher in IU [6.25, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 4.20-9.31] and IP infants (4.76, 95\% CI: 3.58-6.33) than in PN infants (1.70, 95\% CI: 1.16-2.47).

Without a model of adolescent alcohol use that incorporates culture, the field misapprehends the social and cultural grounding of both normal and pathological drinking, and cannot accurately differentiate between normal and pathological drinking. Traditionally, the field has relied upon either a biological model or a distress model, thus locating pathology in the biochemistry of ethanol ingestion or in psychopathological distress. However, findings from an ethnographic investigation of alcohol use among American Indian adolescents suggest that the criteria for distinguishing pathological drinking lie, instead, in the developmental and gender-specific expectations that derive from cultural values. Specifically, at a Northern Plains site, teen drinking is judged by whether drinking has begun to interfere with developmental tasks relating to the cultural values of courage, modesty, humor, generosity and family honor. We conclude with suggestions for clinicians and researchers that offer the potential to facilitate the incorporation of culture into research and practice in the field of American Indian adolescent alcohol use},

  abstract = {Objectives In vitro fertilization (IVF) induced elevated estrogen levels are associated with a hypercoagulable state. Thromboelastogram (TEG) is a point of care whole blood hemostasis analyzer which measures functionality of clotting parameters. Our study's objective was to examine the influence of the early and late follicular phase of an IVF simulation cycle on coagulation parameters as measured by TEG and to evaluate the influence of age on coagulation parameters. Study design In a single center, prospective, observational trial, 46 women undergoing IVF therapy were studied. All women received a standardized IVF treatment protocol. Venous blood was drawn on the first day of the stimulation cycle and on the day of hCG injection and assessed by TEG. Parameters assessed by were R (represent clotting time), K and Angle (reflect clot strength and development), MA (maximum platelet-fibrin clot strength), CI (represents overall coagulability), and LY30 (represents lysis). Results Data from 46 women were analyzed. A statistically significant difference was found in all TEG parameters between early and late follicular phase, indicating a hypercoagulable state. R (p {$<$} 0.0001), K (p = 0.008), angle (p = 0.008), MA (p = 0.004), CI (p {$<$} 0.001), LY30 (p = 0.59). Age was a significant independent predictor for R at the early follicular phase (p = 0.042). Both age and estrogen levels were found to be independent predictors for CI at late follicular phase. Age (p = 0.011), estrogen (p = 0.019). Conclusions There was a significant difference in all coagulation parameters between early and late follicular phase, indicating a hypercoagulable state.},

  abstract = {The prevalence of maternal obesity has risen dramatically in recent years, with approximately one in five pregnant women in the UK now classed as obese (body mass index {$\geq$} 30 kg/m(2) ) at antenatal booking. Obesity during pregnancy has been hypothesized to exert long-term health effects on the developing child through 'early life programming'. While this phenomenon has been well studied in a maternal undernutrition paradigm, the processes by which the programming effects of maternal obesity are mediated are less well understood. In humans, maternal obesity has been associated with a number of long-term adverse health outcomes in the offspring, including lifelong risk of obesity and metabolic dysregulation with increased insulin resistance, hypertension and dyslipidaemia, as well as behavioural problems and risk of asthma. The complex relationships between the maternal metabolic milieu and the developing foetus, as well as the potential influence of postnatal lifestyle and environment, have complicated efforts to study the programming effects of maternal overnutrition in humans. This review will examine the emerging evidence from human studies linking maternal obesity to adverse offspring outcomes.},

First, we use a large sample of both siblings and twins, second, we use a variety of measures of infant health, and finally, we track children through their schooling years and into the labor force. Our findings suggest that poor infant health predicts both mortality within one year, and mortality up to age 17. We also find that infant health is a strong predictor of educational and labor force outcomes. In particular, infant health is found to predict both high school completion and welfare takeup and length.},

The authors present a simple yet easy-to-use Stata command to adjust the relative risk for exposure misclassification, selection bias, and an unmeasured confounder. This command implements both deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analysis. It allows the user to specify a variety of probability distributions for the bias parameters, which are used to simulate distributions for the bias-adjusted exposure-disease relative risk. We illustrate the command by applying it to a case-control study of occupational resin exposure and lung-cancer deaths. By using plausible probability distributions for the bias parameters, investigators can report results that incorporate their uncertainties regarding systematic errors and thus avoid overstating their certainty about the effect under study. These results can supplement conventional results and can help pinpoint major sources of conflict in study interpretations. ?? 2008 StataCorp LP.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Gastroschisis, a birth defect characterized by herniated fetal abdominal wall, occurs more commonly in infants born to teenage and young mothers. Ischemia of the vascular vitelline vessels is the likely mechanism of pathogenesis. Given that chronic stress and violence against women are risk factors for cardiovascular disease we explored whether these may represent risk factors for gastroschisis, when they occur during pregnancy. A case-control study was conducted, with 15 incident cases of children born with gastroschisis in the Region of Murcia, Spain, from December 2007 to June 2013. Forty concurrent controls were recruited at gestation weeks 20-24 or post-partum. All mothers of cases and controls completed a comprehensive, in-person, 'green sheet' questionnaire on environmental exposures. RESULTS: Mothers of children with gastroschisis were younger, smoked more cigarettes per week relative to controls, were exposed to higher amounts of illegal drugs, and suffered from domestic violence more frequently than the controls. Multivariable logistic regression analysis highlights periconceptional 'gender-related violence' (OR: 16.6, 95\% CI 2.7 to 101.7) and younger maternal age (OR 1.1, 95\% CI 1.0-1.3). CONCLUSIONS: Violence against pregnant women is associated with birth defects, and should be studied in more depth as a cause-effect teratogenic. Psychosocial risk factors, including gender-based violence, are important for insuring the health and safety of the pregnant mother and the fetus.},

  abstract = {Numerous studies have reported substantive correlations between indicators of parenting, children's emotion regulation (ER), and children's psychosocial adjustment. However, studies on underlying mechanisms are scarce. Particularly in early adolescence, it is still unclear whether relations between parenting and ER are caused by adolescent behavior, by parent behavior, or by reciprocal processes. Moreover, it is unclear whether ER can be seen as an antecedent or a consequence of psychosocial adjustment. The aim of this study was to examine predictive relations among parenting and adolescents' ER, and adolescents' ER and psychosocial adjustment, respectively. We collected longitudinal, multiple informant data at two measurement occasions (Grade 6, Grade 7). All told, 1,100 adolescents (10-14 years) and their parents filled out questionnaires assessing responsiveness and psychological control, adolescents' anger regulation, and adolescents' problem and prosocial behavior. Cross-lagged analyses revealed reciprocal effects between parenting, ER, and adjustment for the parent and boys', but not for the girls', report. Moreover, relations were different for adolescents with versus without clinically elevated symptoms of psychopathology. Our findings support the assumption that reciprocal relations between parenting, ER, and psychosocial adjustment are likely to persist until early adolescence. Nevertheless, the moderating role of gender and psychopathology should be taken into account. Possible reasons for the different findings, and practical implications, are discussed.},

METHODS: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was used to evaluate brain white matter development in 2-week-old, full-term, appropriate for gestational age (AGA) infants from uncomplicated pregnancies of normal-weight (BMI {$<$} 25 at conception) or obese ( BMI = 30 at conception) and otherwise healthy mothers. Tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) analyses were used for voxel-wise group comparison of fractional anisotropy (FA), a sensitive measure of white matter integrity. DNA methylation analyses of umbilical cord tissue focused on genes known to be important in CNS development were also performed. RESULTS: Newborns from obese women had significantly lower FA values in multiple white matter regions than those born of normal-weight mothers. Global and regional FA values negatively correlated (P {$<$} 0.05) with maternal fat mass percentage. Linear regression analysis followed by gene ontology enrichment showed that methylation status of 68 CpG sites representing 57 genes with GO terms related to CNS development was significantly associated with maternal adiposity status.

We hypothesized that participation in an intervention with specific factors, focused on IPV, parenting and coping, would be associated with better recovery. IPV exposed children and parents were group randomized over a specific factors- and control intervention. Baseline, posttest and follow-up measurements of 155 parents and children (aged 6-12 years, 55.5\% boys) were fitted in a multilevel model. Outcomes were parent and teacher reported children's internalizing and externalizing problems (CBCL, TRF), child self-reported depressive symptoms (CDI) and parent and child reported children's post-traumatic stress symptoms (TSCYC, TSCC). Based on intention-to-treat and completer analyses, children in the specific factors intervention did not show better recovery than children in the control intervention. Children in both interventions decreased significantly in parent-reported children's internalizing and externalizing problems and post-traumatic stress symptoms. Children reported a decrease in their mean level of depressive and post-traumatic stress symptoms. Teachers reported a decrease in internalizing problems, but not in externalizing problems. No association between time since exposure and level and course of symptoms was found. Treatment differentiation was assessed and both programs were significantly different on hypothesized effective factors. Higher treatment adherence in both programs did not result in a larger difference in recovery.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The incidence of gastroschisis, a congenital anomaly where the infant abdominal wall is defective and intestines protrude from the abdominal cavity, is increasing in many countries. The role of maternal stress in some adverse birth outcomes is now well established. We tested the hypothesis that major stressful life events in the first trimester are risk factors for gastroschisis, and social support protective, in a case-control study in the United Kingdom.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nMETHODS: Gastroschisis cases and three controls per case (matched for maternal age) were identified at routine 18-20 week fetal anomaly ultrasound scan, in 2007-2010. Face to face questionnaire interviews were carried out during the antenatal period (median 24 weeks gestation) asking about serious stressful events and social support in the first trimester. Data were analysed using conditional logistic regression.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nRESULTS: Two or more stressful life events in the first trimester (adjusted OR 4.9; 95\% CI 1.2-19.4), and moving address in the first trimester (aOR 4.9; 95\% CI 1.7-13.9) were strongly associated with risk of gastroschisis, independent of behavioural risk factors including smoking, alcohol, and poor diet. Perceived availability of social support was not associated with reduced risk of gastroschisis (aOR 0.8; 95\% CI 0.2-3.1).\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSIONS: Stressful maternal life events in the first trimester of pregnancy including change of address were strongly associated with a substantial increase in the risk of gastroschisis, independent of stress related high risk behaviours such as smoking, alcohol consumption and poor diet. This suggests that stress pathways are involved in the aetiology of gastroschisis.},

  abstract = {Objective: Participation rates have been declining in case-control studies, particularly among controls, raising concerns about possible bias. Formal assessments of the effect of low participation on odds ratios (OR) are seldom presented however. We sought to quantify possible bias using multiple imputation techniques. Methods: Using data from two Australian case-control studies, we estimated the relative risks of oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and adenocarcinoma (OAC), and serous ovarian cancer (SOC) associated with smoking and body mass index (BMI). We compared ORs observed using self-reported data from participating controls with ORs derived using imputed exposures for non-participating controls. Results: Participating controls were less likely than non-participants to smoke currently. Smoking remained significantly associated with oesophageal cancer even under the most extreme assumption of smoking prevalence among non-participants (OSCC: observed OR 6.54, 4.62-9.28, imputed OR 3.94, 2.83-5.49; OAC: observed OR 2.69, 1.87-3.85 imputed OR 1.58, 1.13-2.22). For SOC however, risks associated with smoking were attenuated to null under plausible smoking assumptions among non-participants. BMI distributions were similar among participating and non-participating controls, and risk estimates were essentially unchanged. Conclusion and implications: Bias is not an inevitable consequence of low control participation and depends on the association examined. Sensitivity analyses can assist in interpretation of results. \textcopyright{} 2009 The Authors.},

  abstract = {One approach to quantifying the magnitude of confounding in observational studies is to compare estimates with and without adjustment for a covariate, but this strategy is known to be defective for noncollapsible measures such as the odds ratio. Comparing estimates from marginal structural and standard logistic regression models, the total difference between crude and conditional effects can be decomposed into the sum of a noncollapsibility effect and confounding bias. We provide an analytic approach to assess the noncollapsibility effect in a point-exposure study and provide a general formula for expressing the noncollapsibility effect. Next, we provide a graphical approach that illustrates the relationship between the noncollapsibility effect and the baseline risk, and reveals the behavior of the noncollapsibility effect for a range of different exposure and covariate effects. Various observations about noncollapsibility can be made from the different scenarios with or without confounding; for example, the magnitude of effect of the covariate plays a more important role in the noncollapsibility effect than does that of the effect of the exposure. In order to explore the noncollapsibility effect of the odds ratio in the presence of time-varying confounding, we simulated an observational cohort study. The magnitude of noncollapsibility was generally comparable to the effect in the point-exposure study in our simulation settings. Finally, in an applied example we demonstrate that collapsibility can have an important impact on estimation in practice.},

Conditional logistic regression was used to describe the associations between exposure variables and gastroschisis, adjusted for known confounding variables.\textbackslash nResults The response rate was 73\% for cases (n = 91) and 70\% for controls (n = 217). High consumption of fruits and vegetables during the first trimester (aOR 0.2; 95\% CI 0.04\textendash 0.6), taking folic acid for at least 6 weeks during the first trimester (aOR 0.3; 95\% CI 0.1\textendash 0.7) and increasing body fat percentage of total maternal body weight (aOR 0.9; 95\% CI 0.8\textendash 0.9 per 1\% increase) were independently associated with reduced risk.

The role of menstrual factors as determinants of endometriosis risk has been suggested, women with early menarche, short and heavy menstrual cycles being at higher risk. This has been generally explained by the reflux hypothesis. Parity is inversely associated with the risk of endometriosis, but it is difficult to define if nulliparity is a cause or a consequence of endometriosis. In some studies, the risk of the disease was lower among current oral contraceptive users, but higher in ex-users. However, these different findings may be due to selective mechanisms and indication bias. Other reported risk factors are family history of endometriosis, smoking, alcohol and coffee drinking, a diet rich in saturated fats, overweight (inverse relation), dioxin exposure, personal history of immune disorders.},

Methods: We examined the associations between parity and maternal risk of later-life CVD in a population-based cohort study using data from the Swedish population registers. Women born from 1932 to 1955 were followed until the occurrence of CVD, death, emigration, or end of follow-up (December 31, 2005). Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate associations between parity and risk of CVD accounting for birth year, yearly income, education level, country of birth, hypertension (pregestational hypertension or gestational hypertension, with or without proteinuria), diabetes (type 1, type 2, or gestational diabetes), preterm birth, small for gestational age, and stillbirth. Results: During a median follow-up time of 9.5 years (range 0-23.5), there were 65,204 CVD events in the full sample of women. Among 1,332,062 women, parity was associated with CVD in a J-shaped fashion, with 2 births representing the nadir of risk (global P value {$<$} .0001). Upon accounting for pregnancy-related complications in a subset of women with at least 1 childbirth after 1973 (n = 590,725), the association of parity with CVD was similar. Compared with women with 2~childbirths, the multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (95\% CIs) for women with 1 and {$\geq$}5 births were 1.09 (1.03-1.15) and 1.47 (1.37-1.57), respectively. Conclusions: In conclusion, parity was associated with incident maternal CVD in a J-shaped fashion, even after accounting for socioeconomic factors and pregnancy-related complications. \textcopyright{} 2010 Mosby, Inc.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Subfertility shares common pathways with cardiovascular disease (CVD), including polycystic ovarian syndrome, obesity and thyroid disorders. Women with prior 0-1 pregnancies are at an increased risk of incident CVD when compared with women with two pregnancies. It is uncertain whether history of subfertility among women eventually giving birth is a risk factor for CVD. METHODS: Among Swedish women with self-reported data on subfertility in the Swedish Medical Birth Register (n = 863 324), we used Cox proportional hazards models to relate a history of subfertility to CVD risk after adjustment for age, birth year, highest income, education, birth country, hypertension, diabetes, preterm birth, small for gestational age (SGA), smoking and for BMI in separate models. In additional analyses, we excluded women with: (i) pregnancy-related or non-pregnancy-related hypertension and/or diabetes; and (ii) preterm births and/or SGA babies. RESULTS: Among nulliparous women eventually having a childbirth (between 1983 and 2005, the median follow-up time 11.9; 0-23 years and 9 906 621 person-years of follow-up), there was an increased risk of CVD among women reporting {$\geq$}5 years of subfertility versus 0 years (hazard ratio 1.19, 95\% confidence interval 1.02-1.39). There were not significantly elevated CVD risks for women with 1-2 or 3-4 years of subfertility versus 0 years. Accounting for BMI did not change results. Excluding women with hypertension and/or diabetes attenuated associations, whereas exclusion of women with preterm and/or SGA births did not change findings. CONCLUSIONS: Subfertility among women eventually having a childbirth is a risk factor for CVD even upon accounting for cardiovascular risk factors and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Future studies should explore the mechanisms underlying this association. \textcopyright{} The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.},

METHODS We conducted a cohort study involving 1,325,563 pregnancies in women who were enrolled in Medicaid and who delivered a live-born infant between 2000 and 2010. We examined the risk of cardiac malformations among infants exposed to lithium during the first trimester as compared with unexposed infants and, in secondary analyses, with infants exposed to another commonly used mood stabilizer, lamotrigine. Risk ratios and 95\% confidence intervals were estimated with control for psychiatric and medical conditions, medications, and other potential confounders. RESULTS Cardiac malformations were present in 16 of the 663 infants exposed to lithium (2.41\%), 15,251 of the 1,322,955 nonexposed infants (1.15\%), and 27 of the 1945 infants exposed to lamotrigine (1.39\%). The adjusted risk ratio for cardiac malformations among infants exposed to lithium as compared with unexposed infants was 1.65 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.02 to 2.68). The risk ratio was 1.11 (95\% CI, 0.46 to 2.64) for a daily dose of 600 mg or less, 1.60 (95\% CI, 0.67 to 3.80) for 601 to 900 mg, and 3.22 (95\% CI, 1.47 to 7.02) for more than 900 mg. The prevalence of right ventricular outflow tract obstruction defects was 0.60\% among lithium-exposed infants versus 0.18\% among unexposed infants (adjusted risk ratio, 2.66; 95\% CI, 1.00 to 7.06). Results were similar when lamotrigine-exposed infants were used as the reference group. CONCLUSIONS Maternal use of lithium during the first trimester was associated with an increased risk of cardiac malformations, including Ebstein's anomaly; the magnitude of this effect was smaller than had been previously postulated.},

The latter is the focus of this paper, and includes selection bias, information bias and confounding. Selection bias can be minimised by obtaining a high response rate (and by appropriate selection of the control group in a case-control study). In general, it is important to ensure that information bias is minimised and is also non-differential (for example, that the misclassification of exposure is not related to disease status) by collecting data in a standardised manner. A major concern in occupational epidemiology studies usually relates to confounding, because exposure has not been randomly allocated, and the groups under study may therefore have different baseline disease risks. For each of these types of bias, the goal should be to avoid the bias by appropriate study design and/or appropriate control in the analysis. However, it is also important to attempt to assess the likely direction and strength of biases that cannot be avoided or controlled.},

  abstract = {We explore the different types of causes that are commonly investigated by epidemiologists. We first distinguish between causes which are events (including actions) and causes which are states. Second, we distinguish between modifiable and non-modifiable states. This yields three types of causes: fixed states (non-modifiable), dynamic states (modifiable) and events (including actions). Different causes may have different characteristics: the methods available to study them, the types of possible biases, and therefore the types of evidence needed to infer causality, may differ according to the specific cause-effect relationship under study. Nevertheless, there are also substantial commonalities. This paper is intended to improve understanding of the different types of causes, and the different types of causality, that underpin epidemiological practice.},

  abstract = {The direct effect of one event on another can be defined and measured by holding constant all intermediate variables between the two. Indirect effects present conceptual and practical difficulties (in nonlinear models), because they cannot be isolated by holding certain variables constant. This paper presents a new way of defining the effect transmitted through a restricted set of paths, withour controlling variables on the remaining paths. This permits the assessment of a more natural type of direct and indirect effects, one that is applicable in both linear and nonlinear models and that has broader policy-related interpretations. The paper establishes conditions under which such assessments can be estimated consistently from experimental and nonexperimental data, and thus extends path-analytic techniques to nonlinear and nonparametric models.},

This paper treats a particular problem of generalizability, called ``transportability'', defined as a license to transfer causal effects learned in experimental studies to a new population, in which only observational studies can be conducted. We introduce a formal representation called ``selection diagrams'' for expressing knowledge about differences and commonalities between populations of interest and, using this representation, we reduce questions of transportability to symbolic derivations in the do-calculus. This reduction yields graph-based procedures for deciding whether causal effects in the target population can be inferred from experimental findings in the study population. When the answer is affirmative, the procedures identify what experimental and observational findings need be obtained from the two populations, and how they can be combined to ensure bias-free transport.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Antenatal care (ANC) is a key strategy to improve maternal and infant health. However, survey data from sub-Saharan Africa indicate that women often only initiate ANC after the first trimester and do not achieve the recommended number of ANC visits. Drawing on qualitative data, this article comparatively explores the factors that influence ANC attendance across four sub-Saharan African sites in three countries (Ghana, Kenya and Malawi) with varying levels of ANC attendance. METHODS: Data were collected as part of a programme of qualitative research investigating the social and cultural context of malaria in  pregnancy. A range of methods was employed interviews, focus groups with diverse  respondents and observations in local communities and health facilities. RESULTS: Across the sites, women attended ANC at least once. However, their descriptions of ANC were often vague. General ideas about pregnancy care - checking the foetus' position or monitoring its progress - motivated women to attend ANC; as did, especially in Kenya, obtaining the ANC card to avoid reprimands from health  workers. Women's timing of ANC initiation was influenced by reproductive concerns and pregnancy uncertainties, particularly during the first trimester, and how ANC services responded to this uncertainty; age, parity and the associated implications for pregnancy disclosure; interactions with healthcare workers, particularly messages about timing of ANC; and the cost of ANC, including charges levied for ANC procedures - in spite of policies of free ANC - combined with ideas about the compulsory nature of follow-up appointments. CONCLUSION: In these socially and culturally diverse sites, the findings suggest that 'supply' side factors have an important influence on ANC attendance: the design of ANC and particularly how ANC deals with the needs and concerns of women during the first  trimester has implications for timing of initiation.},

In this and 2 companion papers (Am J Epidemiol. 2018;187(3):576-584 and Am J Epidemiol. 2018;187(3):585-591), we discuss issues pertaining to missing data in the epidemiologic literature. We provide details regarding missing-data mechanisms and nomenclature and encourage the conduct of principled analyses through a detailed comparison of multiple imputation and inverse probability weighting. Data from the Collaborative Perinatal Project, a multisite US study conducted from 1959 to 1974, are used to create a masked data-analytical challenge with missing data induced by known mechanisms. We illustrate the deleterious effects of missing data with naive methods and show how principled methods can sometimes mitigate such effects. For example, when data were missing at random, naive methods showed a spurious protective effect of smoking on the risk of spontaneous abortion (odds ratio (OR) = 0.43, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.19, 0.93), while implementation of principled methods multiple imputation (OR = 1.30, 95\% CI: 0.95, 1.77) or augmented inverse probability weighting (OR = 1.40, 95\% CI: 1.00, 1.97) provided estimates closer to the "true" full-data effect (OR = 1.31, 95\% CI: 1.05, 1.64). We call for greater acknowledgement of and attention to missing data and for the broad use of principled missing-data methods in epidemiologic research.},

The follow-up study was conducted when the children were approximately 5 years of age and included a physical and a neurological evaluation, IQ determination of mother and child, and an interview of mother by a psychologist. Fifty-three infants of insulin-dependent (IDM) and 20 infants of gestational diabetic mothers (IGDM) (83\%) participated, 3 families could not be traced and 12 were unwilling. The group lost to follow-up (13 IDM, 2 IGDM) had more perinatal complications including congenital malformations than the follow-up group. All children had normal physical and neurological development. IQ was normal, the majority were above 100, the average in IDM was 115 (range 98-144) and 112 in IGDM (range 95-133). No obvious relationship was found between maternal acetonuria during pregnancy, infant birthweight, blood glucose during first hours after birth or neonatal complications and IQ of the children. A correlation (r = 0.364, p less than 0.01) was found between maternal and child IQ. Mothers exhibiting emotional disorders (anxiety, depression) had significantly higher life stress scores based on 29 stress variables and reported more frequently about conduct and behavioural disorders in their children than mothers without emotional disturbances.},

  abstract = {This paper describes a targeted maximum likelihood estimator (TMLE) for the parameters of longitudinal static and dynamic marginal structural models. We consider a longitudinal data structure consisting of baseline covariates, time-dependent intervention nodes, intermediate time-dependent covari-ates, and a possibly time-dependent outcome. The intervention nodes at each time point can include a binary treatment as well as a right-censoring indicator. Given a class of dynamic or static interventions, a marginal structural model is used to model the mean of the intervention-specific counterfactual outcome as a function of the intervention, time point, and possibly a subset of baseline covariates. Because the true shape of this function is rarely known, the marginal structural model is used as a working model. The causal quantity of interest is defined as the projection of the true function onto this working model. Iterated conditional expectation double robust estimators for marginal structural model parameters were previously proposed by Robins (2000, 2002) and Bang and Robins (2005). Here we build on this work and present a pooled TMLE for the parameters of marginal structural working models. We compare this pooled estimator to a stratified TMLE (Schnitzer et al. 2014) that is based on estimating the intervention-specific mean separately for each intervention of interest. The performance of the pooled TMLE is compared to the performance of the stratified TMLE and the performance of inverse probability weighted (IPW) estimators using simulations. Concepts are illustrated using an example in which the aim is to estimate the causal effect of delayed switch following immunological failure of first line antiretroviral therapy among HIV-infected patients. Data from the International Epidemiological Databases to Evaluate AIDS, Southern Africa are analyzed to investigate this question using both TML and IPW estimators. Our results demonstrate practical advantages of the pooled TMLE over an IPW estimator for working marginal structural models for survival, as well as cases in which the pooled TMLE is superior to its stratified counterpart.},

  abstract = {Sibling comparison designs have long been used to assess causal effects of exposures for which randomized studies are impossible and measurement of all relevant confounding is unobtainable. The idea is to utilize the fact that siblings often share a lot of unobserved variables. Therefore, it is proposed that in certain cases, comparing siblings is equivalent to comparing exchangeable individuals, which is the foundation for causal inference based on randomized controlled trials (RCTs). However, this intuition\textemdash and the publication of highly important sibling studies\textemdash vastly predate modern causal inference theory. Full causal descriptions of sibling comparison designs are essentially nonexistent, and therefore it is not clear exactly how or if we can interpret their estimated effects as causal. We fill this theoretical gap by proposing a counterfactual-based framework for sibling comparison designs. Moreover, we employ this framework to derive precise causal interpretations for three commonly used sibling model estimators stemming from fixed-effects ordinary least squares (OLS), conditional logistic regression, and stratified Cox regression. We establish that, for the latter two, the obtained effect parameter describes a causal effect on the full sibling group, not the individuals, and thus it does not correspond to the prevailing intuition from the RCT analogue. For fixed-effects OLS estimation, the parameter describes a causal effect on an individual, but may depend on an intervention on the whole sibling group. OLS estimation thus results in an estimator that can be given a simple causal interpretation that is similar, but not equal to, the RCT parallel.

It requires calculating and reporting the total uncertainty in the results, which in turn requires methods for quantifying the uncertainty introduced by systematic error. Quantified uncertainty can improve policy and clinical decisions, better direct further research, and aid public understanding, and thus enhance the contributions of epidemiology. The error quantification approach proposed here is based on estimating a probability distribution for a bias-corrected effect measure based on externally-derived distributions of bias levels. Using Monte Carlo simulation, corrections for multiple biases are combined by identifying the steps through which true causal effects become data, and (in reverse order) correcting for the errors introduced by each step. The bias-correction calculations are the same as those used in sensitivity analysis, but the resulting distribution of possible true values is more than a sensitivity analysis; it is a more complete reporting of the actual study results. The approach is illustrated with an application to a recent study that resulted in the drug, phenylpropanolamine, being removed from the market.

  abstract = {Background: All quantifications of mortality, morbidity, and other health measures involve numerous sources of error. The routine quantification of random sampling error makes it easy to forget that other sources of error can and should be quantified. When a quantification does not involve sampling, error is almost never quantified and results are often reported in ways that dramatically overstate their precision. Discussion: We argue that the precision implicit in typical reporting is problematic and sketch methods for quantifying the various sources of error, building up from simple examples that can be solved analytically to more complex cases. There are straightforward ways to partially quantify the uncertainty surrounding a parameter that is not characterized by random sampling, such as limiting reported significant figures. We present simple methods for doing such quantifications, and for incorporating them into calculations. More complicated methods become necessary when multiple sources of uncertainty must be combined. We demonstrate that Monte Carlo simulation, using available software, can estimate the uncertainty resulting from complicated calculations with many sources of uncertainty. We apply the method to the current estimate of the annual incidence of foodborne illness in the United States. Summary: Quantifying uncertainty from systematic errors is practical. Reporting this uncertainty would more honestly represent study results, help show the probability that estimated values fall within some critical range, and facilitate better targeting of further research.},

  abstract = {Objectives The healthy worker survivor effect is a bias that occurs in occupational studies when less healthy workers are more likely to reduce their workplace exposures. When variables on the pathway from health status to exposure are measured, g-methods can avoid this bias. However, studies in which follow-up ends at employment termination have additional potential for selection bias. This paper examines the structure of the healthy worker survivor effect, compares results with and without censoring at employment termination, and addresses how to prevent bias when such censoring occurs. Methods G-estimation of structural accelerated failure time models was applied in the United Autoworkers- General Motors cohort study to examine relationships between metalworking fluid exposure and cause-specific mortality. Subjects were followed from hire through 1994, regardless of employment status. To answer the central question, g-estimation analysis was repeated after truncating at employment termination and censoring outcomes that occurred thereafter, with adjustment for censoring by inverse probability weighting. Results Using full follow-up time, HRs were estimated for all-cause mortality (1.09), ischaemic heart disease death (1.19), and death from any cancer (1.09), comparing 5 years of metalworking fluid exposure to no exposure. For all three outcomes, the HR estimates based on data censored at termination of employment were below 1 (respectively, 0.92, 0.97, 0.79). Conclusions In this application, g-estimation together with weighting did not prevent selection bias due to employment termination. However, the bias might be avoided in studies with measured health-related variables on the pathway from health status to employment termination.},

In April 2018, the guideline underwent an amendment and incorporated 155 references that were published between January 1990 and December 2017. Two new key questions were added: one on the use of genomic classifiers and the other on the treatment of oligo-metastases with radiation after radical prostatectomy. Results: A new statement on the use of hormone therapy with salvage radiation therapy (RT) after radical prostatectomy was added, and long-term data were used to update an existing statement on adjuvant RT. The balance of the guideline statements were reaffirmed, and references added to the existing literature base. A discussion on the use of genomic classifiers as a risk stratification tool was added to the future research discussion. No relevant data on oligo-metastases were found. Conclusions: Hormone therapy should be offered to patients who have had radical prostatectomy and who are candidates for salvage RT. Clinicians should discuss possible short- and long-term side effects with patients in addition to the potential benefits of preventing recurrence.

Design: Prospective, controlled, cohort study. Setting: Fertility clinic in Brussels, Belgium. Patient(s): Sixty-six ICSI-conceived children prospectively compared with 52 IVF-conceived and 59 spontaneously conceived children. All children were full-term singletons. Intervention(s): Home visits by a trained psychologist. Standardized interviews. Assessments using the revised Brunet-L\'ezine scale and the revised Wechsler preschool and primary scale of intelligence. Main Outcome Measure(s): Physical growth and general health. Formal developmental and intellectual assessments. Result(s): Children conceived by ICSI were healthy: no significant differences appeared in the incidence of combined congenital malformations (11.3\%), health problems (44.1\%), surgical interventions (18.6\%), and hospitalizations (6.8\%), nor for the developmental assessments (mean developmental quotient at 9 months: 93.9; at 18 months: 102.0). For the intellectual assessments, the between-group differences disappeared when adjusted for levels of parental education (mean intelligence quotient at 3 years: 97.0; at 5 years: 103.3). Conclusion(s): This pilot study shows that throughout the preschool period, ICSI-conceived children have psychomotor and intellectual development similar to that of IVF-conceived and spontaneously conceived children. These conclusions need to be confirmed by multicenter studies. \textcopyright{} 2003 by American Society for Reproductive Medicine.},

Current day and daily lagged associa-tions between PM10 levels and PEF were observed. Elevated levels of PMlO pollution also were as-sociated with increases In reported symptoms of respiratory disease and use of asthma medication. Associations between compromised respiratory health and elevated PM lO pollution were observed even when PM,olevels were well below the 24-h national ambient air quality standard of 150 \textasciitilde g/m3. Associations between elevated PM,olevels, reductions In PEF, and increases In symptoms of respi-ratory disease and asthma medication use remained statistically significant even when the only pollution episode that exceeded the standard was excluded. Concurrent measurements indicated that little or no strong particle acidity was present.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Endometriosis is a common gynecologic disease characterized by the ectopic growth of endometrial tissue. In industrialized countries, it affects approximately 10\% of women of reproductive age. Its etiology is unclear, but a multifactorial origin is considered to be most plausible. Environmental organochlorinated persistent pollutants, in particular dioxins and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), have been hypothesized to play a role in the disease etiopathogenesis. However, results of studies carried out on humans are conflicting. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the exposure to organochlorinated persistent pollutants as a risk factor for endometriosis. METHODS: We conducted a case-control study in Rome on 158 women comprising 80 cases and 78 controls. In all women, serum concentrations of selected non-dioxin-like PCBs (NDL-PCBs) and dioxin-like PCBs (DL-PCBs), 1,1-dichloro-2,2,-bis(4-chlorophenyl)-ethene (p,p'-DDE), and hexachlorobenzene (HCB) were determined by ion-trap mass spectrometry. DR-CALUX bioassay was employed to assess the 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin toxicity equivalent (TEQ) concentrations of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs), and DL-PCBs. RESULTS: We found an increased risk of endometriosis for DL-PCB-118 [odds ratio (OR) = 3.79; 95\% confidence interval (CI), 1.61-8.91], NDL-PCB-138 (OR = 3.78; 95\% CI, 1.60-8.94), NDL-PCB-153 (OR = 4.88; 95\% CI, 2.01-11.0), NDL-PCB-170 (OR = 3.52; 95\% CI, 1.41-8.79), and the sum of DL-PCBs and NDL-PCBs (OR = 5.63; 95\% CI, 2.25-14.10). No significant associations were observed with respect to HCB or to the sum of PCDDs, PCDFs, and DL-PCBs given as total TEQs. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study show that an association exists between increased PCB and p,p'-DDE serum concentrations and the risk of endometriosis.},

Objective: To characterize the time course of disease progression in men with biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy. Design: A retrospective review of a large surgical series with median (SD) follow-up of 5.3 (3.7) years (range, 0.5-15 years) between April 1982 and April 1997. Setting: An urban academic tertiary referral institution. Patients: A total of 1997 men undergoing radical prostatectomy, by a single surgeon, for clinically localized prostate cancer. None received neoadjuvant therapy, and none had received adjuvant hormonal therapy prior to documented distant metastases. Main Outcome Measures: After surgery, men were followed up with PSA assays and digital rectal examinations every 3 months for the first year, semiannually for the second year, and annually thereafter. A detectable serum PSA level of at least 0.2 ng/mL was evidence of biochemical recurrence. Distant metastases were diagnosed by radionuclide bone scan, chest radiograph, or other body imaging, which was performed at the time of biochemical recurrence and annually thereafter. Results: The actuarial metastasis-free survival for all 1997 men was 82\% (95\% confidence interval, 76\%-88\%) at 15 years after surgery. Of the 1997 men, 315 (15\%) developed biochemical PSA level elevation. Eleven of these underwent early hormone therapy after the recurrence and are not included in the study. Of the remaining 304 men, 103 (34\%) developed metastatic disease within the study period. The median actuarial time to metastases was 8 years from the time of PSA level elevation. In survival analysis, time to biochemical progression (P{$<$}.001), Gleason score (P{$<$}.001), and PSA doubling time (P{$<$}.001) were predictive of the probability and time to the development of metastatic disease. An algorithm combining these parameters was constructed to stratify men into risk groups. Once men developed metastatic disease, the median actuarial time to death was 5 years. The time interval from surgery to the appearance of metastatic disease was predictive of time until death (P{$<$}.02). Conclusions: Several clinical parameters help predict the outcomes of men with PSA elevation after radical prostatectomy. These data may be useful in the design of clinical trials, the identification of men for enrollment into experimental protocols, and counseling men regarding the timing of administration of adjuvant therapies.},

The utility of mediation analysis stems from its ability to go beyond the merely descriptive to a more functional understanding of the relationships among variables. A necessary component of mediation is a statistically and practically significant indirect effect. Although mediation hypotheses are frequently explored in psychological research, formal significance tests of indirect effects are rarely conducted. After a brief overview of mediation, we argue the importance of directly testing the significance of indirect effects and provide SPSS and SAS macros that facilitate estimation of the indirect effect with a normal theory approach and a bootstrap approach to obtaining confidence intervals, as well as the traditional approach advocated by Baron and Kenny (1986). We hope that this discussion and the macros will enhance the frequency of formal mediation tests in the psychology literature.

  abstract = {Background:  Many studies have documented an obesity paradox\textemdash a survival advantage of being obese\textemdash in populations diagnosed with a medical condition. Whether obesity is causally associated with improved mortality in these conditions is unresolved. Methods: We develop the logic of collider bias as it pertains to the association between smoking and obesity in a diseased population. Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) are used to investigate this bias empirically among persons with diabetes and prediabetes (dysglycemia). We also use NHANES to investigate whether reverse causal pathways are more prominent among people with dysglycemia than in the source population. Cox regression analysis is used to examine the extent of the obesity paradox among those with dysglycemia. In the regression analysis, we explore interactions between obesity and smoking, and we implement a variety of data restrictions designed to reduce the extent of reverse causality. Results: We find an obesity paradox among persons with dysglycemia. In this population, the inverse association between obesity and smoking is much stronger than in the source population, and the extent of illness and weight loss is greater. The obesity paradox is absent among never-smokers. Among smokers, the paradox is eliminated through successive efforts to reduce the extent of reverse causality. Conclusion: Higher mortality among normal-weight people with dysglycemia is not causal but is rather a product of the closer inverse association between obesity and smoking in this subpopulation.},

METHODS: Blood samples were collected from 44 women with endometriosis and 58 without endometriosis, during the first three days (1st sample) and during the 7th, 8th and 9th day (2nd sample) of the menstrual cycle. Measurements of CA-125 and soluble CD-23 were performed by ELISA. Mann-Whitney U test was used for age, pain evaluations (visual analog scale) and biomarkers concentrations. RESULTS: Serum levels of CA125 were higher in endometriosis patients when compared to the control group during both periods of the menstrual cycle evaluated in the study. This marker was also elevated in women with chronic pelvic pain, deep dyspareunia (2nd sample), dysmenorrhea (both samples) and painful defecation during the menstrual flow (2nd sample). CA-125 concentration was higher in advanced stages of the disease in both samples and also in women with ovarian endometrioma. Concerning CD-23, no statistically significant differences were observed between groups. CONCLUSION: The concentrations of CA-125 were higher in patients with endometriosis than in patients without the disease. No significantly differences were observed for soluble CD-23 levels between groups.(AU)\^ien},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Farming populations from developing countries are exposed to seasonal energy stress due to variations in food availability and energy output related to agricultural activities. This study aims to examine the impact of seasonality in maternal intake and activity on neonatal size. METHODS: Maternal anthropometry, dietary intakes (24-h recall and food-frequency questionnaire) and activity pattern (questionnaire) at 18 +/- 2 and 28 +/- 2 weeks gestation, and neonatal anthropometry, were measured in a prospective study of 797 rural Indian women. RESULTS: Maternal energy and protein intakes were inadequate (70\% of recommended dietary allowance). Both intake and activity showed seasonal variation (P = 0.001), with peak values in winter i.e. during harvest, at 18 weeks (median energy 1863 kcal/day, protein 47.5 g/day) and 28 weeks (median energy 1687 kcal/day, protein 43.7 g/day), coinciding with the maximum maternal activity (median score 86.1 at 18 weeks and 79.5 at 28 weeks). Mean birth weight and length (adjusted for pre-pregnant weight, parity, gestation and sex) of babies was highest in summer (peak at February 2733 g, 48.6 cm, respectively) and lowest in winter (nadir at January 2591 g, 47.1 cm, respectively). Regression analysis showed that maternal intake at 18th week had a positive association (P = 0.05), maternal activity at 28th week had a negative association (P = 0.002) and exposure (in weeks) to winter during gestation had a positive association (P = 0.04) with birth size. Furthermore, higher maternal intakes, coupled with lower maternal activity in late gestation were associated with higher birth weight, especially during winter. CONCLUSIONS: If causal, these observations indicate that complete exposure (16 weeks) to the winter season (harvest-time) in late gestation could increase birth weight by 90 g in poor farming communities in rural India, and the benefit would increase further by lowering maternal activity. Our results underscore the importance of considering seasonality in planning targeted intervention strategies in such settings.},

Weight Gain During Pregnancy responds to the need for a reexamination of the 1990 Institute of Medicine guidelines for weight gain during pregnancy. It builds on the conceptual framework that underscored the 1990 weight gain guidelines and addresses the need to update them through a comprehensive review of the literature and independent analyses of existing databases. The book explores relationships between weight gain during pregnancy and a variety of factors (e.g., the mother's weight and height before pregnancy) and places this in the context of the health of the infant and the mother, presenting specific, updated target ranges for weight gain during pregnancy and guidelines for proper measurement. New features of this book include a specific range of recommended gain for obese women. Weight Gain During Pregnancy is intended to assist practitioners who care for women of childbearing age, policy makers, educators, researchers, and the pregnant women themselves to understand the role of gestational weight gain and to provide them with the tools needed to promote optimal pregnancy outcomes."--Back cover},

  abstract = {The Zika virus has spread rapidly in the Americas since its first identification in Brazil in early 2015. Prenatal Zika virus infection has been linked to adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes, most no-tably microcephaly and other serious brain anom-alies. To determine whether Zika virus infection during pregnancy causes these adverse out-comes, we evaluated available data using criteria that have been proposed for the assessment of potential teratogens. On the basis of this review, we conclude that a causal relationship exists be-tween prenatal Zika virus infection and micro-cephaly and other serious brain anomalies. Evi-dence that was used to support this causal relationship included Zika virus infection at times during prenatal development that were consis-tent with the defects observed; a specific, rare phenotype involving microcephaly and associated brain anomalies in fetuses or infants with pre-sumed or confirmed congenital Zika virus infec-tion; and data that strongly support biologic plausibility, including the identification of Zika virus in the brain tissue of affected fetuses and infants. Given the recognition of this causal rela-tionship, we need to intensify our efforts toward the prevention of adverse outcomes caused by congenital Zika virus infection. However, many questions that are critical to our prevention ef-forts remain, including the spectrum of defects caused by prenatal Zika virus infection, the de-gree of relative and absolute risks of adverse out-comes among fetuses whose mothers were in-fected at different times during pregnancy, and factors that might affect a woman's risk of ad-verse pregnancy or birth outcomes. Addressing these questions will improve our ability to reduce the burden of the effects of Zika virus infection during pregnancy.},

  abstract = {Recent clinical trials demonstrating that hormone replacement therapy (HRT) does not prevent coronary heart disease in women have again raised doubts concerning observational studies. Although much of the explanation probably lies in what might be called the "healthy HRT user" effect, another contributing factor may be that most observational studies included many prevalent users: women taking HRT for some time before study follow-up began. This practice can cause two types of bias, both of which plausibly may have contributed to the discrepancy between observational and randomized studies. First, prevalent users are "survivors" of the early period of pharmacotherapy, which can introduce substantial bias if risk varies with time, just as in studies of operative procedures that enroll patients after they have survived surgery. This article provides several examples of medications for which the hazard function varies with time and thus would be subject to prevalent user bias. Second, covariates for drug users at study entry often are plausibly affected by the drug itself. Investigators often do not adjust for these factors on the causal pathway, which may introduce confounding. A new-user design eliminates these biases by restricting the analysis to persons under observation at the start of the current course of treatment. This article thus argues that such designs should be used more frequently in pharmacoepidemiology.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disorder with increasing prevalence worldwide, yet has unclear etiology.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nOBJECTIVE: We explored the association between maternal exposure to particulate matter (PM) air pollution and odds of ASD in her child.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nMETHODS: We conducted a nested case-control study of participants in the Nurses' Health Study II (NHS II), a prospective cohort of 116,430 U.S. female nurses recruited in 1989, followed by biennial mailed questionnaires. Subjects were NHS II participants' children born 1990-2002 with ASD (n = 245), and children without ASD (n = 1,522) randomly selected using frequency matching for birth years. Diagnosis of ASD was based on maternal report, which was validated against the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised in a subset. Monthly averages of PM with diameters {$\leq$} 2.5 {$\mu$}m (PM2.5) and 2.5-10 {$\mu$}m (PM10-2.5) were predicted from a spatiotemporal model for the continental United States and linked to residential addresses.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nRESULTS: PM2.5 exposure during pregnancy was associated with increased odds of ASD, with an adjusted odds ratio (OR) for ASD per interquartile range (IQR) higher PM2.5 (4.42 {$\mu$}g/m3) of 1.57 (95\% CI: 1.22, 2.03) among women with the same address before and after pregnancy (160 cases, 986 controls). Associations with PM2.5 exposure 9 months before or after the pregnancy were weaker in independent models and null when all three time periods were included, whereas the association with the 9 months of pregnancy remained (OR = 1.63; 95\% CI: 1.08, 2.47). The association between ASD and PM2.5 was stronger for exposure during the third trimester (OR = 1.42 per IQR increase in PM2.5; 95\% CI: 1.09, 1.86) than during the first two trimesters (ORs = 1.06 and 1.00) when mutually adjusted. There was little association between PM10-2.5 and ASD.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSIONS: Higher maternal exposure to PM2.5 during pregnancy, particularly the third trimester, was associated with greater odds of a child having ASD.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCITATION: Raz R, Roberts AL, Lyall K, Hart JE, Just AC, Laden F, Weisskopf MG. 2015.

  abstract = {recent analysis found that exposure to air pollution during specific weeks of pregnancy was negatively associated with risk of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) when mutually adjusted for postnatal air-pollution exposure. In this commentary, we describe 2 possible selection-bias processes that might lead to such results, both related to live-birth bias (i.e., the inevitable restriction of the analyzed sample to live births). The first mechanism is described using a directed acyclic graph and relates to the chance of live birth being a common consequence of both exposure to air pollution and another risk factor of ASD. The second mechanism involves preferential depletion of fetuses susceptible to ASD in the higher air-pollution exposure group. We further discuss the assumptions underlying these processes and their causal structures, their plausibility, and other studies where similar phenomenamight have occurred.},

Our intention is to help review authors in any field to set eligibility criteria for studies to include in a systematic review that relate directly to the intrinsic strength of the studies in inferring causality. We also seek to clarify key equivalences and differences in terminology used by different research communities. Study Design and Setting Expert consensus meeting. Results The checklist comprises seven questions, each with a list of response items, addressing: clustering of an intervention as an aspect of allocation or due to the intrinsic nature of the delivery of the intervention; for whom, and when, outcome data are available; how the intervention effect was estimated; the principle underlying control for confounding; how groups were formed; the features of a study carried out after it was designed; and the variables measured before intervention. Conclusion The checklist clarifies the basis of credible quasi-experimental studies, reconciling different terminology used in different fields of investigation and facilitating communications across research communities. By applying the checklist, review authors' attention is also directed to the assumptions underpinning the methods for inferring causality.},

Recent explorations unveil the usefulness of the do-calculus in three additional areas: mediation analysis [Pearl, 2012], transportability [Pearl and Bareinboim, 2011] and metasynthesis. Meta-synthesis (freshly coined) is the task of fusing empirical results from several diverse studies, conducted on heterogeneous populations and under different conditions, so as to synthesize an estimate of a causal relation in some target environment, potentially different from those under study. The talk surveys these results with emphasis on the challenges posed by meta-synthesis. For background material, see http://bayes.cs.ucla.edu/csl\_papers.html},

The majority (76\%) of adolescents reported witnessing or being victimized by at least 1 violent event in the prior 6 months. Nearly half of adolescents who had talked about their experience of a violent event reported feeling constrained from sharing their thoughts or feelings because of others' reactions. After controlling for daily hassles, more exposure to violence was associated with more self-reported posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depressive symptoms. Exposure to violence was not a significant predictor of teachers' ratings of adaptive functioning or internalizing symptoms. Support from specific individuals, perceived school safety, and lower constraints for discussing violence showed protective effects in the relation between exposure to violence and specific dimensions of psychological functioning. The implications of this research for school-based interventions are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Some authors stress the role that early life stress (ELS) may play in the pathophysiology of depressive symptoms. However, the involvement of the HPA-axis in linking prenatal ELS with depressive symptoms has not been tested in a prospective-longitudinal study extending until after puberty in humans. Therefore, we examined whether antenatal maternal anxiety is associated with disturbances in HPA-axis regulation and whether the HPA-axis dysregulation mediates the association between antenatal maternal anxiety and depressive symptoms in post-pubertal adolescents. As part of a prospective-longitudinal study, we investigated maternal anxiety at 12\textendash 22, 23\textendash 32, and 32\textendash 40 weeks of pregnancy (wp) with the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). In the 14\textendash 15-year-old offspring (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 58) HPA-axis function was measured through establishing a saliva cortisol day-time profile. Depressive symptoms were measured with the Children's Depression symptoms Inventory (CDI). Results of regression analyses showed that antenatal exposure to maternal anxiety at 12\textendash 22 wp was in both sexes associated with a high, flattened cortisol day-time profile (P {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.0463) which, in female adolescents only, was associated with depressive symptoms (P {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.0077). All effects remained after controlling for maternal smoking, birth weight, obstetrical optimality, maternal postnatal anxiety and puberty phase.

However, the extent to which birthweight reflects fetal growth, or is a marker of subsequent size, with respect to this association, is not clear. We therefore investigated the independent effects of birthweight and postnatal height adjusted for postnatal weight on cognitive function and educational attainment while controlling for family background. METHODS: Using the British 1946 birth cohort we investigated the association between cognitive function at various ages and birthweight, height adjusted for weight in childhood and adulthood, and educational attainment, controlling for sex, father's social class, maternal education, birth order, and maternal age. RESULTS: Birthweight was positively associated with cognition up to age 26, and with the likelihood of obtaining advanced educational qualifications. Height was positively associated with cognition at all ages, and also with educational attainment. Weight was not associated with cognition at ages 8 and 15, but was negatively associated with verbal ability at age 26, with verbal memory at age 43, and with educational attainment. These effects were independent of each other, and of family background. Conditional analyses suggested the positive effect of height growth on cognition at two intervals, one in early childhood, and the other in late adolescence. In addition, weight gain after age 15 was negatively associated with cognition at 26. CONCLUSION: Birthweight and postnatal growth are independently associated with cognition.},

We used repeated measures of a comprehensive set of inflammatory markers to investigate the relationship between early life measures and systemic inflammation in an African population.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nMETHODS: Individuals born in three rural villages in The Gambia, and for whom early life measurements were recorded, were traced (n = 320). Fasting levels of eight inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, serum amyloid A, orosomucoid, fibrinogen, {$\alpha$} 1-antichymotrypsin, sialic acid, interleukin-6 and neopterin) were measured, and potential confounding factors recorded. The association between early life measurements and systemic inflammation was assessed using regression analysis.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nRESULTS: Levels of most markers were unrelated to early growth patterns. In analyses adjusted for age and sex, more rapid growth between birth and 3 months of age was associated with higher levels of fibrinogen, orosomucoid, and sialic acid. These relationships persisted after further adjustment for body mass index but after full adjustment only the association with fibrinogen remained.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSIONS: This study provides little evidence that size at birth or growth in early infancy determine levels of inflammatory markers in young Gambian adults.},

In this paper, we discuss 2 analytic approaches that might be used to assess associations between the explanatory variables and an outcome other than the original disease. One is through the inclusion of a design variable for original disease status as a covariate; and, the second is through weighted logistic regression using the inverse of the sampling fractions as the weights. The latter approach allows the investigator to derive an estimate of association between the explanatory variables and the second disease without adjustment for the first disease. Weighted logistic regression methods are readily implemented using available statistical packages.},

  abstract = {Directed acyclic graph (DAG) models may be characterized in at least four different ways: via a factorization, the d-separation criterion, the moralization criterion, and the local Markov property. As pointed out by Robins (1986, 1999), Verma and Pearl (1990), and Tian and Pearl (2002b), marginals of DAG models also imply equality constraints that are not conditional independences. The well-known `Verma constraint' is an example. Constraints of this type were used for testing edges (Shpitser et al., 2009), and an efficient marginalization scheme via variable elimination (Shpitser et al., 2011). We show that equality constraints like the `Verma constraint' can be viewed as conditional independences in kernel objects obtained from joint distributions via a fixing operation that generalizes conditioning and marginalization. We use these constraints to define, via Markov properties and a factorization, a graphical model associated with acyclic directed mixed graphs (ADMGs). We show that marginal distributions of DAG models lie in this model, prove that a characterization of these constraints given in (Tian and Pearl, 2002b) gives an alternative definition of the model, and finally show that the fixing operation we used to define the model can be used to give a particularly simple characterization of identifiable causal effects in hidden variable graphical causal models.},

  abstract = {In epidemiological studies it is often necessary to disentangle the pathways that link an exposure to an outcome. Typically the aim is to identify the total effect of the exposure on the outcome, the effect of the exposure that acts through a given set of mediators of interest (indirect effect) and the effect of the exposure unexplained by those same mediators (direct effect). The traditional approach to mediation analysis is based on adjusting for the mediator in standard regression models to estimate the direct effect. However, several methodological papers have shown that under a number of circumstances this traditional approach may produce flawed conclusions. Through a better understanding of the causal structure of the variables involved in the analysis, with a formal definition of direct and indirect effects in a counterfactual framework, alternative analytical methods have been introduced to improve the validity and interpretation of mediation analysis. In this paper, we review and discuss the impact of the three main sources of potential bias in the traditional approach to mediation analyses: (i) mediator-outcome confounding;(ii) exposure-mediator interaction and (iii) mediator-outcome confounding affected by the exposure. We provide examples and discuss the impact these sources have in terms of bias.},

Estrogen dependence and immune modulation are established features of this disease, and environmental contaminants have been suggested to play a role in the pathobiology of this disease as well. Previous work in nonhuman primates has shown that exposure to the dioxin 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) is associated with an increased prevalence and severity of endometriosis. Further animal experiments have implicated dioxin and dioxin-like compounds in this disease. Rodent studies support the plausibility of a role of environmental contaminants in the pathophysiology of endometriosis, although a convincing mechanistic hypothesis has yet to be advanced. Small hospital-based case-control studies have failed to provide compelling evidence for or against an association of environmental contaminants and endometriosis. Herein we review evidence that dioxin and dioxin-like compounds are potent modulators of immune and endocrine function critical to the pathobiology of endometriosis. Furthermore, perspectives on the potential mechanism(s) of dioxin and dioxin-like compound-induced toxicity in endometriosis, important knowledge needs, potential animal models for endometriosis studies, and considerations integral to future human case-control studies are discussed.},

  abstract = {Certain statistical models specify a conditional mean function, given a random effect and covariates of interest. On the other hand, one may instead model a marginal mean only in terms of the covariates. We discuss some common situations where conditional and marginal means coincide. In a Gaussian linear mixed effects model we have equivalent interpretations of the conditional and marginal regression parameter estimates. Similar results exist for more general link functions. In this paper we give a short overview of some models, where conditional and marginal results are equivalent and we illustrate this with some examples. When the conditional mean is additive in a random effect on the log scale, it is seen that the marginal mean equals the conditional mean plus a constant, such that slope parameters have the same interpretation in both formulations. No further distributional assumptions are needed in either of these cases. With a logit link and a double exponential random effect, a closed form marginal link function is derived from the conditional model. When a logit or probit link is used with a normal random effect, the marginal mean parameters become attenuated by a factor which depends on parameters of the distribution of the covariates. In a conditional Weibull proportional hazards model with a positive stable frailty, the marginal hazards are again Weibull but with slope parameters attenuated towards zero.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: It is not clear to what extent maternal metabolism during pregnancy affects the cognitive and behavioral function of the offspring by altering brain development in utero. To investigate this question, we correlated measures of metabolism in pregnant diabetic and nondiabetic women with the intellectual development of their offspring. METHODS: The study included 223 pregnant women and their singleton offspring: 89 women had diabetes before pregnancy (pregestational diabetes mellitus), 99 had the onset of diabetes during pregnancy (gestational diabetes mellitus), and 35 had normal carbohydrate metabolism during their pregnancy. We correlated measures of maternal glucose and lipid metabolism (fasting plasma glucose levels, hemoglobin A1c levels, episodes of hypoglycemia, episodes of acetonuria, and plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate and free fatty acid levels) with two measures of intellectual development in the offspring--the mental development index of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development, given at the age of two years, and the Stanford--Binet Intelligence Scale, given at the ages of three, four, and five years and expressed as an average of the three scores. RESULTS: After correction for socioeconomic status, race or ethnic origin, and patient group, the children's mental-development-index scores at the age of two years correlated inversely with the mothers' third-trimester plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate levels (r = -0.21, P less than 0.01); the average Stanford-Binet scores correlated inversely with third-trimester plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate (r = -0.20, P less than 0.02) and free fatty acid (r = -0.27, P less than 0.002) levels. No other correlations were significant. Including various perinatal events (e.g., prematurity and acidemia) in the analyses did not alter the results. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal diabetes during pregnancy may affect behavioral and intellectual development in the offspring. The associations between gestational ketonemia in the mother and a lower IQ in the child warrant continued efforts to avoid ketoacidosis and accelerated starvation in all pregnant women.},

However, the published literature does not consider women's perspectives or the potential negative ramifications of screening. Methods: Twenty semistructured interviews and two focus groups (n = 38) were conducted with a racially/ethnically diverse sample of low-income pregnant and parenting women using alcohol and/or drugs in a northern California county. Results: Most women were averse to having drug but not alcohol use identified and were mistrustful of providers' often inconspicuous efforts to discover drug use. Women expected psychological, social, and legal consequences from being identified, including feelings of maternal failure, judgment by providers, and reports to Child Protective Services. Women did not trust providers to protect them from these consequences. Rather, they took steps to protect themselves. They avoided and emotionally disengaged from prenatal care, attempted to stop using substances that could be detected by urine tests before prenatal care visits, and shared strategies within social networks for gaining the benefits of prenatal care while avoiding its negative consequences. Conclusion: Considerations of the public health impact of screening for drug use in prenatal care should account for the implications of women's physical avoidance of and emotional disengagement from prenatal care, specifically the direct effects of late, limited, and no prenatal care on pregnancy outcomes and missed opportunities for health promoting interventions. ?? 2010 Jacobs Institute of Women's Health.},

This study sought to understand how drug use and factors associated with drug use influence women's prenatal care use. A total of 20 semi-structured interviews and 2 focus groups were conducted with a racially/ethnically diverse sample of low-income women using alcohol and drugs in a California county. Women using drugs attend and avoid prenatal care for reasons not connected to their drug use: concern for the health of their baby, social support, and extrinsic barriers such as health insurance and transportation. Drug use itself is a barrier for a few women. In addition to drug use, women experience multiple simultaneous risk factors. Both the drug use and the multiple simultaneous risk factors make resolving extrinsic barriers more difficult. Women also fear the effects of drug use on their baby's health and fear being reported to Child Protective Services, each of which influence women's prenatal care use. Increasing the number of pregnant women who use drugs who receive prenatal care requires systems-level rather than only individual-level changes. These changes require a paradigm shift to viewing drug use in context of the person and society and acceptance of responsibility for unintended consequences of public health bureaucratic procedures and messages about effects of drug use during pregnancy.},

There is concern that alcohol abstinence recommendations lead women using low levels of alcohol to terminate otherwise wanted pregnancies. This study examines how women describe alcohol, tobacco and/or drug use (ATOD) as reasons for deciding to have abortions and assesses the differences between women reporting and not reporting ATOD as reasons for deciding to have an abortion.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nMETHODS: Data come from the UCSF Turnaway Study which recruited 956 women seeking an abortion at one of 30 US clinics between 2008 and 2010. Mixed methods were used and data were analyzed through thematic coding and logistic regression.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nRESULTS: Nearly 5\% reported ATOD as a reason for abortion. Women worried that their ATOD had affected their baby's health and that their or their partner's ATOD would influence parenting. Most women (84\%) who reported alcohol as a reason binge drank or had an alcohol-problem symptom in the month before discovering their pregnancy. Sixty-one percent who reported drugs as a reason used drugs, with 88\% using more than once/week. Although two-thirds smoked tobacco, no woman reported tobacco alone as a reason. Ninety-eight percent of women reporting ATOD as a reason had unintended pregnancies.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSION: Women reporting ATOD as a reason drink at levels exceeding a low threshold and do not appear to be terminating otherwise wanted pregnancies. Thus, findings are inconsistent with hypotheses that abstinence recommendations and punitive policies lead women using low levels of alcohol or using drugs to terminate otherwise wanted pregnancies.},

For example, in occupational mortality studies, date of termination of employment is both a determinant of subsequent exposure to the chemical agent under study (since terminated individuals receive no further exposure) and an independent risk factor for death (since disabled individuals tend to leave employment). When a risk factor determines subsequent exposure and is determined by previous exposure, standard analyses that estimate age-specific mortality rates as a function of cumulative exposure can underestimate the true effect of exposure on mortality, whether or not one adjusts for the risk factor in the analysis. This observation raises the question, "Which, if any, empirical population parameter can be causally interpreted as the true effect of exposure in observational mortality studies?" In answer, we offer a graphical approach to the identification and estimation of causal parameters in mortality studies with sustained exposure periods. We reanalyze the mortality experience of a cohort of arsenic-exposed copper smelter workers using our approach and compare our results with those obtained using standard methods. We find an adverse effect of arsenic exposure on all cause and lung cancer mortality, which standard methods failed to detect. The analytic approach introduced in this paper may be necessary to control bias in any epidemiologic study in which there exists a risk factor which both determines subsequent exposure and is determined by previous exposure to the agent under study.},

We show that adjustment for the intermediate variable, which is the most common method of estimating direct effects, can be biased. We also show that, even in a randomized crossover trial of exposure, direct and indirect effects cannot be separated without special assumptions; in other words, direct and indirect effects are not separately identifiable when only exposure is randomized. If the exposure and intermediate never interact to cause disease and if intermediate effects can be controlled, that is, blocked by a suitable intervention, then a trial randomizing both exposure and the intervention can separate direct from indirect effects. Nonetheless, the estimation must be carried out using the G-computation algorithm. Conventional adjustment methods remain biased. When exposure and the intermediate interact to cause disease, direct and indirect effects will not be separable even in a trial in which both the exposure and the intervention blocking intermediate effects are randomly assigned. Nonetheless, in such a trial, one can still estimate the fraction of exposure-induced disease that could be prevented by control of the intermediate. Even in the absence of an intervention blocking the intermediate effect, the fraction of exposure-induced disease that could be prevented by control of the intermediate can be estimated with the G-computation algorithm if data are obtained on additional confounding variables.},

Although patients randomized to the bactrim arm experienced a significant delay in time to PCP, the survival experience in the two arms was not significantly different (p = .32). In this paper, we present evidence that bactrim therapy improves survival but that the standard intent-to-treat comparison failed to detect this survival advantage because a large fraction of the subjects either crossed over to the other therapy or stopped therapy altogether. We obtain our evidence of a beneficial bactrim effect on survival by artificially regarding the subjects as dependently censored at the first time the subject either stops or switches therapy; we then analyze the data with the inverse probability of censoring weighted Kaplan-Meier and Cox partial likelihood estimators of Robins (1993, Proceedings of the Biopharmaceutical Section, American Statistical Association, pp. 24-33) that adjust for dependent censoring by utilizing data collected on time-dependent prognostic factors.},

If, conditional on the history of the observed data up to t, the hazard of dropping out of the study (i.e., censoring) at time t does not depend on the possibly unobserved data subsequent to t, we say drop-out is ignorable or explainable (Rubin, 1976). On the other hand, if the hazard of drop-out depends on the possibly unobserved future, we say drop-out is non-ignorable or, equivalently, that there is selection bias on unobservables. Neither the existence of selection bias on unobservables nor its magnitude is identifiable from the joint distribution of the observables. In view of this fact, we argue that the data analyst should conduct a "sensitivity analysis" to quantify how one's inference concerning an outcome of interest varies as a function of the magnitude of non-identifiable selection bias. \textbackslash n},

(1993), the Non-Parametric Structural Equation Model (NPSEM) of Pearl (2000), and the Minimal Counterfactual Model (MCM) which we introduce. The latter is referred to as `minimal' because it imposes the minimal counterfactual independence assumptions required to identify those causal contrasts representing the effect of an ideal intervention on any subset of the variables in the graph. The causal contrasts identified by an MCM are, in general, a strict subset of those identified by a NPSEM associated with the same graph. We analyze various measures of the `direct' causal effect, focussing on the pure direct effect (PDE), also called the `natural direct effect'. We show the PDE is a parameter that may be identified in a DAG viewed as a NPSEM, but not as an MCM. In spite of this, Pearl has given a scenario in which the PDE corresponds to the intent-to-treat parameter of a randomized experiment. We resolve this apparent paradox by showing that implicit within Pearl's account is an extended causal DAG with additional variables in which there is a causal contrast that equals the pure direct effect of Pearl's original NPSEM. Further, this contrast is identified from observational data on the original variables. Finally we relate our results to the work of Avin et al. (2005) on path-specific causal effects.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is currently no standard way of defining malaria seasonality, resulting in a wide range of definitions reported in the literature. Malaria cases show seasonal peaks in most endemic settings, and the choice and timing for optimal malaria control may vary by seasonality. A simple approach is presented to describe the seasonality of malaria, to aid localized policymaking and targeting of interventions. METHODS: A series of systematic literature reviews were undertaken to identify studies reporting on monthly data for full calendar years on clinical malaria, hospital admission with malaria and entomological inoculation rates (EIR). Sites were defined as having 'marked seasonality' if 75\% or more of all episodes occurred in six or less months of the year. A 'concentrated period of malaria' was defined as the six consecutive months with the highest cumulative proportion of cases. A sensitivity analysis was performed based on a variety of cut-offs. RESULTS: Monthly data for full calendar years on clinical malaria, all hospital admissions with malaria, and entomological inoculation rates were available for 13, 18, and 11 sites respectively. Most sites showed year-round transmission with seasonal peaks for both clinical malaria and hospital admissions with malaria, with a few sites fitting the definition of 'marked seasonality'. For these sites, consistent results were observed when more than one outcome or more than one calendar year was available from the same site. The use of monthly EIR data was found to be of limited value when looking at seasonal variations of malaria transmission, particularly at low and medium intensity levels. CONCLUSION: The proposed definition discriminated well between studies with 'marked seasonality' and those with less seasonality. However, a poor fit was observed in sites with two seasonal peaks. Further work is needed to explore the applicability of this definition on a wide-scale, using routine health information system data where possible, to aid appropriate targeting of interventions.},

In particular, we are concerned with identifying opportunities for strengthening capacity at the global and local level for implementing protocols necessary to ensure that reviews that include quasi-experiments are consistently of the highest quality. We first describe the current state of the global infrastructure that facilitates the production of systematic reviews of health systems research. We identify five important types of actors operating within this infrastructure: review authors; synthesis collaborations that facilitate the review process; synthesis interest groups that supplement the work of the larger collaborations; review funders; and end users, including policymakers. Then, we examine opportunities for intervening to build the capacity of each type of actors to support the inclusion of quasi-experiments in reviews. Finally, we suggest practical next steps for proceeding with capacity building efforts. Because of the complexity and relative nascence of the field, we recommend a carefully planned and executed approach to strengthening global capacity for the inclusion of quasi-experimental studies in systematic reviews.},

This article proposes five prescriptions for capturing the full value of quasi-experiments for health research. First, new funding opportunities targeting proposals that use quasi-experimental methods should be made available to a broad pool of health researchers. Second, administrative data from health programs, often amenable to quasi-experimental analysis, should be made more accessible to researchers. Third, training in quasi-experimental methods should be integrated into existing health science graduate programs to increase global capacity to use these methods. Fourth, clear guidelines for primary research and synthesis of evidence from quasi-experiments should be developed. Fifth, strategic investments should be made to continue to develop new innovations in quasi-experimental methodologies. Tremendous opportunities exist to expand the use of quasi-experimental methods to increase our understanding of which health programs and policies work and which do not. Health researchers should continue to expand their commitment to rigorous causal evaluation with quasi-experimental methods, and international institutions should increase their support for these efforts.},

  abstract = {The Cree of James Bay have the highest ever reported mean birth weight and a high prevalence of infant macrosomia. This study was designed to examine independent risk factors for infant macrosomia among the Cree, to compare these to risk factors among non-Native Canadians and to determine if ethnic differences persist after adjusting for differences in the distribution of other risk factors. Macrosomia was defined as birth weight {$>$}90(th) percentile for gestational age of a reference population. Independent determinants of macrosomia were examined in 385 Cree and 5644 non-Native women. The potential effect of ethnicity (Cree vs. non-Native) was determined after statistically adjusting for age, parity, pregravid weight, height, net rate of weight gain, gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and smoking status. The prevalence of macrosomia among the Cree was 34.3\% vs. 11.1\% among non-Natives. Although GDM significantly increased the risk for macrosomia among the Cree (odds ratio: 4.46, 95\% CI: 2.24-9.26), it was not a significant risk factor among non-Natives (odds ratio: 1.15, 95\% CI: 0.79-1.65). The risk for infant macrosomia remained elevated among the Cree compared with non-Natives after adjusting for other risk factors (odds ratio: 3.64, 95\% CI: 2.69-4.90). In conclusion, the Cree have a high prevalence of macrosomia despite controlling for important differences in pregravid weight and GDM. Some of this variation may be due to genetic differences in fetal growth. The differential impact of GDM on macrosomia in the two ethnic groups may be due to differences in treatment strategies for GDM.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: There are some indications that maternal lifestyle during pregnancy (smoking and stress) contributes to symptoms of ADHD in children. We prospectively studied whether prenatal exposure to maternal smoking and/or stress is associated with ADHD symptoms and diagnostic criteria (according to DSM-IV) in 7-year-olds. METHODS: Nulliparous Scandinavian women were consecutively recruited at their first prenatal health care visit and assessments of smoking and stress were collected at gestational weeks 10, 12, 20, 28, 32, and 36. Children were followed up at 7 years old. We obtained full data for 72\% of the sample: ADHD symptoms were rated by 74\% of mothers (n=290) and 96\% of eligible teachers (n=208). Attrition analyses showed no differences on key variables between participants and non-participants at follow-up. RESULTS: Results of multiple regression analyses showed prenatal exposure to smoking (beta=.16, p{$<$}.01) and stress (beta=.18, p{$<$}.01) were independently associated with later symptoms of ADHD. Results of logistic regression analyses showed that fulfillment of the diagnostic criteria for ADHD was related to exposure to prenatal stress (beta=.68, p{$<$}.01) especially in boys. The results were not confounded by sociodemographic factors or birth outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that prenatal exposure to stress and smoking is independently associated with later symptoms of ADHD in human children, particularly for boys. Because stress and smoking are relatively common during pregnancy, and yet preventable, these results are of public health significance.},

Teachers rated inattention and hyperactivity symptoms in offspring. High scores were defined as at least one core symptom rated as 'severe' and two as 'present' (approximately 10\% of children scored in this range). Logistic regression and latent class analyses were used to examine maternal pregnancy weight in relation to children's ADHD core symptoms.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nRESULTS: Teacher rated 12 556 school-aged children. Gestational weight gain outside of the Institute of Medicine guidelines was not related to ADHD symptoms (below recommendations: odds ratio (OR): 0.96; 95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.81, 1.14; above recommendations: OR: 0.98; 95\% CI: 0.82, 1.16). To examine various patterns of pre-pregnancy BMI and weight gain, we used latent class analysis and found significant associations between classes that included pre-pregnancy overweight or obesity and a high ADHD symptom score in offspring, ORs ranged between 1.37 (95\% CI: 1.07, 1.75) and 1.89 (95\% CI: 1.13, 3.15) adjusted for gestational age, birth weight, weight gain, pregnancy smoking, maternal age, maternal education, child gender, family structure and cohort country of origin.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to replicate and extend previous work showing an association between maternal pre-pregnancy adiposity and risk for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms in children. METHODS: A Swedish population-based prospective pregnancy-offspring cohort was followed up when children were 5 years old (N = 1,714). Mothers and kindergarten teachers rated children's ADHD symptoms, presence and duration of problems, and emotionality. Dichotomized outcomes examined difficulties of clinical relevance (top 15\% of the distribution). Analyses adjusted for pregnancy (maternal smoking, depressive symptoms, life events, education, age, family structure), birth outcomes (birth weight, gestational age, infant sex) and concurrent variables (family structure, maternal depressive symptoms, parental ADHD symptoms, and child overweight) in an attempt to rule out confounding. RESULTS: Maternal pre-pregnancy overweight and obesity predicted high inattention symptom scores and obesity was associated with a two-fold increase in risk of difficulties with emotion intensity and emotion regulation according to teacher reports. Means of maternal ratings were unrelated to pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI). Presence and duration of problems were associated with both maternal over and underweight according to teachers. CONCLUSIONS: Despite discrepancies between maternal and teacher reports, these results provide further evidence that maternal pre-pregnancy overweight and obesity are associated with child inattention symptoms and extend previous work by establishing a link between obesity and emotional difficulties. Maternal adiposity at the time of conception may be instrumental in programming child mental health, as prenatal brain development depends on maternal energy supply. Possible mechanisms include disturbed maternal metabolic function. If maternal pre-pregnancy obesity is a causal risk factor, the potential for prevention is great.},

We extend these endeavors by broadening the definition of differentiation to include participation in the labor market. As increasing proportions of students continue their educational journeys beyond compulsory schooling, they are considering not only whether to stay in school but also whether to simultaneously enter the world of work. Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth of 1997 (NLSY97), we show that family background influences not only whether students make specific educational transitions but also whether they combine those educational transitions with work. Student trajectories are also path dependent, with employment during one educational transition being related to specific transition patterns at a later point in time. Considering how students combine school and work reveals another dimension of differentiation which can be exploited by socioeconomically advantaged families to "effectively maintain" inequality in educational outcomes. ?? 2009 International Sociological Association Research Committee 28 on Social Stratification and Mobility.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND. Periconceptional vitamin supplementation reduces the risk of neural tube defects, and possibly may reduce the risk of certain childhood malignancies, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Because children with Down syndrome (DS) experience a 20-fold higher risk of leukemia than the general population, the authors evaluated whether periconceptional vitamin supplementation reduced the risk of leukemia in children with DS. METHODS. From 1997 to 2002, 158 children ages birth-18 years with DS and acute leukemia (n = 61 children with acute myeloid leukemia [AML] and n = 97 children with ALL) were enrolled through the Children's Oncology Group in North America. Children with DS alone (n = 173) were identified through the cases' pediatric clinics and frequency matched to cases on age. Mothers of cases and controls completed a telephone interview that included questions regarding vitamin supplement use in the periconceptional period and after knowledge of pregnancy. RESULTS. A decreased risk of leukemia was observed with vitamin supplementation in the periconceptional period (odds ratio [OR] = 0.63; 95\% confidence interval [95\% CI], 0.39-1.00). When stratified by leukemia type, the reduced risk was observed for ALL (OR = 0.51; 95\% CI, 0.30-0.89), but not for AML (OR = 0.92; 95\% CI, 0.48 -1.76). Compared with vitamin use in the periconceptional period, use only after knowledge of pregnancy was associated with an increased risk of leukemia (OR = 1.61; 95\% CI, 1.00-2.58). This was observed for both ALL and AML. CONCLUSIONS. These data added to a growing body of evidence that suggests that periconceptional vitamin use may be protective in the development of certain childhood cancers. \textcopyright{} 2005 American Cancer Society.},

That was the case for two advisors to the U.S. National Children's Health Study, who resigned when the study design was changed so that representativeness was threatened. 2 We admire people who take a stand for principle over expediency, but what exactly is the principle that representativeness embodies?

To stimulate discussion of outmoded thinking regarding the conduct of research, I list six misconceptions about research that persist long after their flaws have become apparent. The misconceptions are: 1) There is a hierarchy of study designs; randomized trials provide the greatest validity, followed by cohort studies, with case-control studies being least reliable. 2) An essential element for valid generalization is that the study subjects constitute a representative sample of a target population. 3) If a term that denotes the product of two factors in a regression model is not statistically significant, then there is no biologic interaction between those factors. 4) When categorizing a continuous variable, a reasonable scheme for choosing category cut-points is to use percentile-defined boundaries, such as quartiles or quintiles of the distribution. 5) One should always report P values or confidence intervals that have been adjusted for multiple comparisons. 6) Significance testing is useful and important for the interpretation of data. These misconceptions have been perpetuated in journals, classrooms and textbooks. They persist because they represent intellectual shortcuts that avoid more thoughtful approaches to research problems. I hope that calling attention to these misconceptions will spark the debates needed to shelve these outmoded ideas for good.},

Although biochemical and immuno- logical abnormalities develop several years before the clinical onset of insulin dependent diabetes, the age at which exposure to infection might induce the disease is unclear. The high prevalence of diabetes mellitus in patients with the congenital rubella syndrome shows that the process may be initiated in utero.1 As most viral infections are seasonal, the pattern of dates of birth of people with diabetes should differ from that of the gen- eral population if a significant proportion of cases was caused by intrauterine or perinatal viral infection.

We describe and demonstrate how existing sensitivity analyses for unobserved confounding---propensity score calibration, Vanderweele and Arah's bias formulas, and Rosenbaum's sensitivity analysis---can be adapted to address this problem. In a simulation study, we examined the extent to which these sensitivity analyses can correct for several measurement error structures: classical, systematic differential, and heteroscedastic covariate measurement error. We then apply these approaches to address covariate measurement error in estimating the association between depression and weight gain in a cohort of adults in Baltimore City. We recommend the use of Vanderweele and Arah's bias formulas and propensity score calibration (assuming it is adapted appropriately for the measurement error structure), as both approaches perform well for a variety of propensity score estimators and measurement error structures.},

In this article, we identify the instrumental variable-direct effect of the exposure on the outcome not through the mediator, using randomization of the instrument. We call this estimand the complier stochastic direct effect (CSDE). To our knowledge, such an estimand has not previously been considered or estimated. We propose and evaluate several estimators for the CSDE: a ratio of inverse-probability of treatment-weighted estimators (IPTW), a ratio of estimating equation estimators (EE), a ratio of targeted minimum loss-based estimators (TMLE), and a TMLE that targets the CSDE directly. These estimators are applicable for a variety of study designs, including randomized encouragement trials, like the Moving to Opportunity housing voucher experiment we consider as an illustrative example, treatment discontinuities, and Mendelian randomization. We found the IPTW estimator to be the most sensitive to finite sample bias, resulting in bias of over 40\% even when all models were correctly specified in a sample size of N = 100. In contrast, the EE estimator and TMLE that targets the CSDE directly were far less sensitive. The EE and TML estimators also have advantages in terms of efficiency and reduced reliance on correct parametric model specification. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

Cognitive functioning was evaluated with the Bayley Scales of Infant Development (2nd ed.; N. Bayley, 1993) at both ages. Infant information processing was also assessed with an infant-controlled habituation procedure. Results indicated that (a) infants of cocaine-abusing women had higher neonatal medical and environmental risk scores; (b) at 8 months, exposure groups did not differ in Psychomotor Development Index, Mental Development Index (MDI) scores, or recovery to a novel stimulus; and (c) infants heavily exposed to cocaine or high environmental risk had a decrease in MDI scores from 8 to 18 months. These results were obtained when neonatal medical and environmental risk, as well as polydrug exposure, were controlled.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE California children's exposures to polybrominated diphenyl ether flame retardants (PBDEs) are among the highest measured worldwide. We previously reported associations for prenatal and childhood PBDE exposures with decrements in attention, processing speed, fine motor coordination, and cognition in children at ages 5 and 7years. Here, we investigate associations of PBDEs with attention and executive function at ages 9 to 12years in the expanded CHAMACOS cohort. METHODS We measured PBDEs in prenatal and child age 9year serum samples for families enrolled in the study since pregnancy ("CHAM1", N=321). In a subsequent cohort for which families were enrolled at child age 9 ("CHAM2", N=301), we measured PBDEs in maternal and child samples collected at child age 9, and used predictive modeling to estimate prenatal exposure levels. We examined associations of measured and estimated PBDE concentrations on children's attention and executive functioning at ages 9, 10{$\frac{1}{2}$}, and 12years. RESULTS Geometric means for prenatal and childhood {$\Sigma$}PBDE levels (sum of PBDE-47, -99, -100, -153) for the expanded CHAMACOS cohort were 26.3 and 63.2ng/g lipid, respectively, and did not differ significantly between CHAM1 and CHAM2 families. We found consistent associations of prenatal exposure to PBDEs with poorer attention and executive function, measured with parent report and direct neuropsychological testing of the child. For example, using GEE models of repeated outcome measures at ages 9 and 12, a 10-fold increase in prenatal {$\Sigma$}PBDE was associated with poorer response consistency on the Conners' Continuous Performance Test II ({$\beta$}=2.9; 95\% CI: 0.9, 4.8) and poorer working memory on the Behavioral Rating Inventory of Executive Function ({$\beta$}=2.5; 95\% CI: 0.5, 4.4). Child age 9 {$\Sigma$}PBDE levels were associated with poorer parent-reported attention and executive function for girls but not boys. CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest that the prefrontal cortex may be a potential target for PBDE exposure and add to a growing literature showing that these ubiquitous toxicants may adversely affect neurodevelopment.},

  abstract = {The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor that upon activation by the toxicant 2,3,7,8 tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) stimulates gene expression and toxicity. AHR is also important for normal mouse physiology and may play a role in cancer progression in the absence of environmental toxicants. The objective of this report was to identify AHR-dependent genes (ADGs) whose expression is regulated by AHR in the absence of toxicants. RNA-Seq analysis revealed that AHR regulated the expression of over 600 genes at an FDR{$<$}10\% in MCF-7 breast cancer cells upon knockdown with short interfering RNA. Pathway analysis revealed that a significant number of ADGs were components of TCDD and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) pathways. We also demonstrated that siRNA knockdown of AHR modulated TNF induction of MNSOD and cytotoxicity in MCF-7 cells. Collectively, the major new findings of this report are: (1) endogenous AHR promotes the expression of xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes even in the absence of toxicants and drugs, (2) AHR by modulating the basal expression of a large fraction of TNF target genes may prime them for TNF stimulation and (3) AHR is required for TNF induction of MNSOD and the cellular response to cytotoxicity in MCF-7 cells. This latter result provides a potentially new role for AHR in MCF-7 cancer progression as a mediator of TNF and antioxidant responses.},

  abstract = {Background: Studies of couple fertility over time have often examined study populations with broad age ranges at a cross-section of time. An increase in fertility has been observed in studies that followed episodes of fertility events either prospectively among nulliparous women or retrospectively among parous women. Fertility has a biological effect on parity. If defined at a cross-section of time, parity will also be affected by year of birth, and thus becomes a collider. Conditioning (stratifying, restricting, or adjusting) on a collider may cause selection bias in the studied association. Methods: A study with prospective follow-up was taken as the model to assess the validity of fertility studies. We demonstrate the potential for selection bias using causal graphs and nationwide birth statistics and other demographic data. We tested the existence of parity-conditioning bias in data including both parous and nulliparous women. We also used a simulation approach to assess the strength of the bias in populations with prior at-risk cycles. Finally, we evaluated the potential for selection bias due to conditioning on parity in various sampling frames. Results: Analyses indicate that the observed increase in fertility over time can be entirely explained by selection bias due to parity-conditioning. Conclusion: Heterogeneity in fertility and differential success in prior at-risk cycles are the ultimate factors behind the selection bias. The potential for selection bias due to parity-conditioning varies by sampling frame. A prospective multidecade study with representative sampling of birth cohorts and follow-up from menarche to menopause would bypass the described bias.},

In extended adoption analyses, offspring (n = 82,698) resembled their not-lived-with fathers and their lived-with mothers. There was stronger resemblance to lived-with mothers, providing indirect evidence of rearing-environment influences on the intergenerational transmission of divorce. The heritability of divorce assessed across generations was 0.13. We attempted to replicate our findings using within-generation data from adoptive and biological siblings (ns = 8,523\textendash 53,097). Adoptees resembled their biological, not adoptive, siblings in their history of divorce. Thus, there was consistent evidence that genetic factors contributed to the intergenerational transmission of divorce but weaker evidence for a rearing-environment effect of divorce. Within-generation data from siblings supported these conclusions.},

  abstract = {This paper assesses the seasonal variations of the time and financial costs of illness for rural households in Burkina Faso. It is based on a multiple round survey of 566 households, which included a time allocation study. The economic parameters of households which influence health seeking behavior changed substantially between the dry and rainy seasons: revenues fell in the rainy season and were exceeded by expenditures. Household production was at its peak in the rainy season resulting in significantly higher opportunity costs of time. At the same time illness perception changed: in the rainy season, significantly fewer illness episodes were perceived, and of those, the proportion perceived as severe decreased over-proportionally. Households shifted their healer choice in the rainy season away from high cost treatment, such as the hospital and dispensary, to low cost home treatment. For all these reasons, households incurred significantly fewer costs of illness in the rainy season (27\% of dry season costs). Household health care expenditures were reduced to 1/6 of dry season levels, the time costs incurred by healthy household members to tend to the sick was reduced to 1/5 and the time costs of work incapacity due to sickness fell to about 1/2 of dry season levels. The authors stress the need to carry out research in all relevant seasons when studying health seeking behavior and the household costs of illness in order to avoid serious seasonal bias. They suggest policy options to increase health care utilization in the rainy season by reducing the financial and time costs of access to health care. Finally, the authors put forward a hypothesis to be tested by future research: They argue that the cognitive (changes in illness perception) and behavioral changes (different health care seeking) reflect the high opportunity costs of time and the low availability of cash households face during the rainy season. The paper discusses the negative implication that untreated illness has on the health status of household members.},

The children were selected from low ({$<$} 1.5 parts per million) and high ({$\geq$}1.5 parts per million) fluoride areas. A questionnaire was used to collect information on the children's personal characteristics, residential history, medical history, educational level of the head of the family, and socioeconomic status of the family. Levels of lead, arsenic, and iodine in the urine and the levels of fluoride in the water and urine were analyzed. The children's intelligence was measured using Raven's Standard Progressive Matrices. Data analysis was done using the chi-square, one way analysis of variance, simple linear regression, and multiple linear regression tests. P value {$<$}0.05 was considered statistically significant.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nRESULTS: Differences in participant's sociodemographic characteristics, urinary iodine, urinary lead, and urinary arsenic levels were statistically not significant (P{$>$}0.05). However, a statistically significant difference was observed in the urinary fluoride levels (P 0.000). Reduction in intelligence was observed with an increased water fluoride level (P 0.000). The urinary fluoride level was a significant predictor for intelligence (P 0.000).\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSION: Children in endemic areas of fluorosis are at risk for impaired development of intelligence.},

  abstract = {Standard cohort and case\textendash control designs are suited to the study of cumulative effects of chronic exposures, but they are prone to confounding by indication. Case\textendash crossover and case\textendash time\textendash control studies are especially useful for studying intermittent exposures with transient effects, and are less susceptible to confounding by indication. Each design has its strengths and weaknesses. Despite the increasing availability of automated databases, cohort studies are usually time consuming and expensive, and therefore not preferred for time-critical decisions. In case\textendash control studies, the selection of appropriate controls can be difficult and time consuming, and sometimes impractical when the exposure is rare. Case\textendash crossover studies use the exposure history of each case as his or her own control to examine the effect of transient exposures on acute events. It further allows to study the time relationship of immediate effects to the exposure. This design eliminates between-person confounding by constant characteristics, including chronic indications. Because exposure data for the case and control periods are provided by the same person, the problems of differential recall may be reduced in many but not all case\textendash crossover studies. Bias can result from temporal changes in prescribing or within-person confounding, including transient indication or changes in disease severity. The case\textendash time\textendash control design is an elaboration of the case\textendash crossover design, which uses exposure history data from a traditional control group to estimate and adjust for the bias from temporal changes in prescribing. This paper will present a structured decision table of when to use which design in pharmacoepidemiologic research. In conclusion, case\textendash crossover and case\textendash time\textendash control studies are the designs of choice when separating acute effects from chronic effects of transient exposures and if confounding by indication is an outstanding problem. \textcopyright{} 1997 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

We demonstrate using simulated datasets and regression analysis that under violations of longitudinal positivity, typical associational estimates between treatment over time and the outcome of interest may be misleading depending on the data-generating structure. Finally, we explain how one may define ``treatment strategies,'' such as ``treat with medication unless contraindicated,'' to overcome the problems linked to time-varying eligibility. Finally, we show how contrasts between the expected potential outcomes under these strategies may be consistently estimated with inverse probability weighting methods.

It remains however unclear how to obtain valid bootstrap inference when dealing with multiple imputation to address missing data. We present four methods which are intuitively appealing, easy to implement, and combine bootstrap estimation with multiple imputation. We show that three of the four approaches yield valid inference, but that the performance of the methods varies with respect to the number of imputed data sets and the extent of missingness. Simulation studies reveal the behavior of our approaches in finite samples. A topical analysis from HIV treatment research, which determines the optimal timing of antiretroviral treatment initiation in young children, demonstrates the practical implications of the four methods in a sophisticated and realistic setting. This analysis suffers from missing data and uses the \$g\$-formula for inference, a method for which no standard errors are available.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Preclinical animal studies have established stressors, substance use associated cues, and priming as distinct triggers of relapse in substance dependence. These triggers seem to induce relapse by activating distinct brain pathways. In order to test these findings in humans, it is necessary to establish new human research paradigms. Neuroimaging may help to study brain regions involved in mediating the effects of these distinct triggers of relapse and to further delineate mediators of these pathways. In order to understand individual differences it is crucial to assess the impact of moderators on these pathways to relapse. METHODS: Paradigms to study distinct relapse triggers are currently being set up for tobacco dependence. It is practically impossible to study human relapse and specifically its neurobiological pathways in the natural surrounding. Instead we aim to establish vulnerability patterns in a laboratory environment, applying functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) assessments during trigger exposure. Brain activation determined by fMRI may constitute a sensitive measure to assess responses to cues, stress, and priming. Establishing these paradigms will then allow to further delineate the role of possible mediators (e.g. attention, inhibition) and moderators (e.g. sex, genetic factors) underlying relapse to smoking. RESULTS: Initial results are encouraging, but this approach needs further studies to proof its usefulness. CONCLUSIONS: We outline an approach to study nicotine relapse within a laboratory environment, using fMRI assessments during trigger exposure. The long term goal is rational treatment development. To reach this goal it is crucial to identify, include and investigate critical moderators and mediators of relapse within this approach.},

  abstract = {Estimation of causal effects using observational data continues to grow in popularity in the epidemiologic literature. While many applications of causal effect estimation use propensity score methods or G-computation, targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE) is a well-established alternative method with desirable statistical properties. TMLE is a doubly robust maximum-likelihood-based approach that includes a secondary "targeting" step that optimizes the bias-variance tradeoff for the target parameter. Under standard causal assumptions, estimates can be interpreted as causal effects. Because TMLE has not been as widely implemented in epidemiologic research, we aim to provide an accessible presentation of TMLE for applied researchers. We give stepby-step instructions for using TMLE to estimate the average treatment effect in the context of an observational study. We discuss conceptual similarities and differences between TMLE and 2 common estimation approaches (G-computation and inverse probability weighting) and present findings on their relative performance using simulated data. Our simulation study compares methods under parametric regression misspecification; our results highlight TMLE's property of double robustness. Additionally, we discuss best practices for TMLE implementation, particularly the use of ensembled machine learning algorithms. Our simulation study demonstrates all methods using super learning, highlighting that incorporation of machine learning may outperform parametric regression in observational data settings.},

With the existence of widespread endemic fluorosis in India, the possible adverse effect of elevated fluoride in drinking water on the Intelligence Quotient (IQ) level of children is a potentially serious public health problem. Aims and Objectives: This study assessed the Intelligence Quotient (IQ) of school going children aged 10-12 years in villages of Mysore district with different fluoride levels. Materials and Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 405 school children aged 10- 12 years were selected from three villages in Mysore district with normal fluoride (1.20 mg F/l), low fluoride (0.40 mg F/l) and high fluoride (2.20 mg F/l) in their water supplies. A pre designed questionnaire was used to collect the required data for the survey which included socio demographic details, oral hygiene practices, diet history, body mass index and dental fluorosis. Intelligence Quotient was assessed using Raven's colored Progressive Matrices Test. Results: In bivariate analysis, significant relationships were found between water fluoride levels and Intelligence Quotient of school children (P {$<$} 0.05). In the high fluoride village, the proportion of children with IQ below 90, i.e. below average IQ was larger compared to normal and low fluoride village. Age, gender, parent education level and family income had no significant association with IQ. Conclusion: School children residing in area with higher than normal water fluoride level demonstrated more impaired development of intelligence when compared to school children residing in areas with normal and low water fluoride levels. Thus, children's intelligence can be affected by high water fluoride levels.},

Specifically, the asymptotic distribution of maximum likelihood estimators and likelihood ratio statistics are derived. These results gen-eralize the work of Moran (1971), Chant (1974), and Chernoff (1954). Some of Chant's results are shown to be incorrect. The approach used in deriving these results follows from comments made by Moran and Chant. The problem is shown to be asymptotically equivalent to the problem of estimating the restricted mean of a multi-variate Gaussian distribution from a sample of size 1. In this represen-tation the Gaussian random variable corresponds to the limit of the normalized score statistic and the estimate of the mean corresponds to the limit of the normalized maximum likelihood estimator. Thus the limiting distribution of the maximum likelihood estimator is the same as the distribution of the projection of the Gaussian random variable onto the region of admissible values for the mean. A variety of examples is provided for which the limiting distributions of likelihood ratio statistics are mixtures of chi-squared distributions. One example is provided with a nuisance parameter on the boundary for which the asymptotic distribution is not a mixture of chi-squared distributions.},

  abstract = {Although understanding the role of race, ethnicity, and identity is central to political science, methodological debates persist about whether it is possible to estimate the effect of something immutable. At the heart of the debate is an older theoretical question: Is race best understood under an essentialist or constructivist framework? In contrast to the ``immutable characteristics'' or essentialist approach, we argue that race should be operationalized as a ``bundle of sticks'' that can be disaggregated into elements. With elements of race, causal claims may be possible using two designs: (a) studies that measure the effect of exposure to a racial cue and (b) studies that exploit within-group variation to measure the effect of some manipulable element. These designs can reconcile scholarship on race and causation and offer a clear framework for future research.},

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of excessive fluoride intake on the intelligence quotient (IQ) of children living in five rural areas in Makoo/Iran.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nMATERIALS AND METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 293 children aged 6-11 years were selected from five villages in Makoo with normal fluoride (0.8{$\pm$}0.3 ppm), medium fluoride (3.1{$\pm$}0.9 ppm) and high fluoride (5.2{$\pm$}1.1 ppm) in their water supplies. The IQ of each child was measured by the Raven's test. Educational and residential information and the medical history of each child was recorded by a questionnaire completed by the parents. Data were analyzed by ANOVA test with a significance level of 0.05.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nRESULTS: The mean IQ scores decreased from 97.77{$\pm$}18.91 for the normal fluoride group to 89.03{$\pm$}12.99 for the medium fluoride group and to 88.58{$\pm$}16.01 for the high fluoride group (P=0.001).\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSION: Children residing in areas with higher than normal water fluoride levels demonstrated more impaired development of intelligence. Thus, children's intelligence may be affected by high water fluoride levels.},

Participants included 97 ethnically and demographically diverse mother-child dyads with children ranging in age from 7 to 12. Mothers reported indicators of supportive and unsupportive emotion socialization practices, and measures of child emotion regulation and emotion dysregulation. Higher scores on the familial risk index were positively related to increased emotion dysregulation and negatively related to decreased emotion regulation through mediated effects of mothers' unsupportive reactions to children's negative emotional expressions. These findings suggest the importance of considering contextual influences on the emotion socialization process and offer potential avenues to foster adaptive emotional development in the context of high risk.

  abstract = {Purpose: Inadequate prenatal care and higher incidences of higher-risk behaviors and gestational diabetes, in addition to other significant determinants of health, place aboriginal women at increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analyses of pregnancy and neonatal outcomes among aboriginal women. Methods: We searched Medline, Embase, and CINAHL for English-language studies reporting rates of pregnancy and neonatal outcomes among aboriginal women. Data were extracted by three reviewers in duplicate. Study quality was assessed for biases in selection, exposure assessment, confounder adjustment, analyses, outcomes assessment, and attrition. Data were synthesized using random effect model. Subgroup analyses were performed based on the country of origin of the aboriginal women. Results: Thirty-eight studies of low to moderate risk of biases were included. Adjustment for confounding factors was performed in eight studies. Unadjusted odds of low birth weight (LBW), preterm birth (PTB), stillbirth, neonatal and perinatal mortality were increased among infants born to aboriginal women. However, adjusted odds were only increased for PTB and stillbirths. Subgroup analyses revealed higher unadjusted odds of LBW, PTB, stillbirth, and neonatal and perinatal mortality among Australian aboriginals; PTB, macrosomia, stillbirth and neonatal and perinatal mortality among Canadian aboriginals, and PTB and neonatal mortality among American Indians and Alaskan Native women. Conclusion: Aboriginal women are at increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes especially PTB; however, future studies assessing confounders adjusted estimates are needed. Differences in outcomes exist based on the country of origin of aboriginal women, reasons for which should be investigated. \textcopyright{} 2011 Jacobs Institute of Women's Health.},

  abstract = {In this paper, the authors use the rubric of "coarsened data," of which missing and censored data are special cases, to motivate the elicitation and use of expert information for performing sensitivity analyses of censored event-time data. Elicited information is important because observed data are insufficient to estimate how study participants with coarsened data compare with participants with uncoarsened data, and misspecifying this comparison may produce biased analysis results. In the presence of coarsening, performing a sensitivity analysis over a range of plausible assumptions is the best one can do. Here the authors illustrate an approach for eliciting expert information for use in sensitivity analyses to compare cumulative incidence functions of censored nonmortality outcomes. An example of such data is the AIDS Link to Intravenous Experience (ALIVE) Study, where the authors aim to estimate and compare cumulative incidence functions for human immunodeficiency virus between risk factor categories. The interval and right-censoring and censoring due to death found in the ALIVE data (1988-1998) are thought to be informative; thus, a sensitivity analysis is performed using information elicited from 2 ALIVE scientists and an expert in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome epidemiology about the relation between seroconversion and censoring. \textcopyright{} The Author 2008.

We use an inverse-probability weighted (IPW) estimator to derive a doubly robust augmented inverse-probability weighted (AIPW) estimator. IPW estimation involves weights for the exposure mechanism, dropout, and mortality; AIPW estimation additionally involves estimating data-generating models via regression. We demonstrate that the estimators identify a causal contrast that is a function of principal strata effects under a set of assumptions. Simulations show that AIPW estimation is unbiased when weights or outcome regressions are correct, and that AIPW estimation is more efficient than IPW estimation when all models are correct. We apply the method to a study of vitamin D and gait speed among older adults.},

STUDY DESIGN: In a population-based cohort study, maternal birth data were linked to a Washington State database, including the birth certificates of 18,905 first-born singleton infants (1987-1995). RESULTS: Among non-Hispanic white subjects, maternal birth weight of 2500 to 3999 g was associated with a 20.9\% risk of cesarean delivery, which was the lowest risk, compared with 24.5\% for a maternal birth weight {$<$}2500 g (P {$<$}.05) and 24.0\% for a maternal birth weight {$>$} or =4000 g (P {$<$}.05). Similar patterns of risk were noted among Hispanic and Native American subjects, although the associations did not reach statistical significance. Risk of cesarean delivery was not associated with maternal birth weight among African American subjects. Among non-Hispanic white subjects, the risk of cesarean delivery was 3.23 times greater with a maternal birth weight {$<$}2500 g and an infant birth weight {$>$} or =4000 g compared with pregnancies with both maternal and infant birth weights between 2500 and 3999 g (P {$<$}. 001). Adjustment for socioeconomic factors did not alter these results. CONCLUSION: Low and high maternal birth weights exert an intergenerational risk of cesarean delivery in nulliparous non-Hispanic white women.},

We were interested in investigating the joint effect of these two risk factors to identify thresholds in risk associated with body mass index (BMI) for a given age. Data from the National Birth Defects Prevention Study included 464 case infants with gastroschisis and 4842 healthy controls. A generalised additive model with a bivariate spline for continuous maternal age and prepregnancy BMI was used to model the probability of gastroschisis. The bivariate spline in BMI and maternal age was significantly associated with gastroschisis (P = 0.0001) after adjustment for study centre, maternal race/ethnicity, education, income and number of persons supported by income, smoking, alcohol use, vitamin use, vasoconstrictor medication use and gestational diabetes. The data indicate that women who are younger and who have lower BMI are at the greatest risk; a woman with a BMI of 17 who gives birth at age 15 has 7 times the odds (adjusted odds ratio = 7.0 [95\% CI 4.2, 11.5]) of having an offspring with gastroschisis compared with a woman of age 24 with a BMI of 23. Furthermore, there was an interaction between maternal age and BMI for this risk. The increased risk of low maternal age and prepregnancy BMI associated with gastroschisis appears to suggest an aetiological role related to biological immaturity for this particular birth defect.},

Adolescents who reported more intense and labile emotions and less effective regulation of these emotions also reported more depressive symptoms and problem behavior. Responding to negative emotions with disengagement (e.g., denial) or involuntary engagement (e.g., rumination) was less effective in regulating negative affect, and greater use of these strategies was related to higher levels of depressive symptoms and problem behavior.},

Forty-one cocaine-exposed, VLBW infants, followed in a longitudinal study, were compared with 41 non-cocaine-exposed, VLBW infants of comparable race, social class, age, and incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Cocaine-exposed infants were identified on the basis of combined findings of maternal and/or infant urine immunoassay and on the basis of maternal self-report. At birth, groups did not differ on medical risk factors except that cocaine-exposed infants had a higher incidence of mild (grades I to II) intraventricular hemorrhage. Cocaine-using women were also more likely to use other drugs, especially alcohol, marijuana, and tobacco. At follow-up, at mean corrected ages of 16.5 +/- 8 months for 30 cocaine-exposed infants and 18.5 +/- 7 months for 37 non-cocaine-exposed infants, standardized assessments of cognitive (Mental Development Index) and motor (Psychomotor Development Index) development were administered. Cocaine-exposed infants had lower mean cognitive (83 +/- 27 vs 91 +/- 19), and motor (85 +/- 25 vs 96 +/- 18) scores; the incidence of developmental delay was significantly higher even after control for the effects of intraventricular hemorrhage and chronologic age. Cocaine-exposed VLBW infants were also more likely to be living with relatives or in foster homes. We conclude that these VLBW, cocaine-exposed infants were at increased risk of intraventricular hemorrhage, were more likely to be placed outside maternal care, and had higher incidences of cognitive and motor delays at follow-up.},

  abstract = {METHODS: Various developmental problems including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have been linked to biological deficiencies in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Additionally, there is evidence that symptoms may be reduced with PUFA supplementation. This study investigated effects of supplementation with PUFAs on symptoms typically associated with ADHD. Because nutrients work synergistically, additional effects of micronutrient supplementation were also investigated. A total of 132 Australian children aged 7 to 12 years with scores {$>$} or = 2 SD above the population average on the Conners ADHD Index participated in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind intervention over 15 weeks, taking PUFAs alone, PUFAs + micronutrients, or placebo. Due to unreturned questionnaires, data were only available for 104 children. RESULTS: Significant medium to strong positive treatment effects were found on parent ratings of core ADHD symptoms, inattention, hyperactivity/impulsivity, on the Conners Parent Rating Scale (CPRS) in both PUFA treatment groups compared with the placebo group; no additional effects were found with the micronutrients. After a one-way crossover to active supplements in all groups for a further 15 weeks, these results were replicated in the placebo group, and the treatment groups continued to show significant improvements on CPRS core symptoms. No significant effects were found on Conners Teacher Rating Scales. CONCLUSION: These results add to preliminary findings that ADHD-related problems with inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity might respond to treatment with PUFAs and that improvements may continue with supplementation extending to 30 weeks.},

Trained staff weighed and measured 4538 children in grades 1 and 2 in 94 primary schools. Weight classification was performed using the IOTF reference and school areas were classified based on level of urbanization and area-level education. Overweight was found in 17\% of the children including 3\% obese. For overweight, odds-ratios were 1.33 and 1.61 (significant) in semi-urban and rural areas, relative to urban areas. After adjusting for area-level education, differences by degree of urbanisation were greatly attenuated and non-significant. For obesity urban-rural differences were observed in boys only and remained after adjustment for area-level education. For area-level education, risk estimates were significantly elevated and unaffected by urbanization and gender, odds-ratios 1.75 and 2.21 for overweight and 2.62 and 3.69 for obesity, in medium- and low-education areas compared to high-education areas. This supports earlier reports identifying areas with low socioeconomic status as high-risk areas for overweight and obesity. However, this study also suggests that gender should be considered when targeting children in urban as well as rural communities for health promoting interventions.},

The most common models in epidemiologic research are logistic regression and Cox regression, which estimate conditional (on the confounders) odds ratios and hazard ratios. When the model has been fitted, one can use regression standardization to estimate marginal measures of association. If the measured confounders are sufficient for confounding control, then the marginal association measures can be interpreted as poulation causal effects. In this paper we describe a new R package, stdReg, that carries out regression standardization with generalized linear models (e.g. logistic regression) and Cox regression models. We illustrate the package with several examples, using real data that are publicly available.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Multiple identical sets of sera from cancer cases and controls would facilitate standardized testing of biomarkers. We describe the creation and use of standard serum sets developed from healthy donors and pooled sera from ovarian, breast, and endometrial cancer cases. METHODS: Two hundred seventy-five 0.3-mL aliquots of sera were created for each of the 95 healthy women, and residual serum was pooled to create 275 identical sets of 20 0.3-mL aliquots. Aliquots (1.0-1.5 mL) from 441 women were combined to create 12 breast and pelvic disease pools with at least 115 0.3-mL aliquots. Sets were assembled to contain aliquots from individual controls, replicates, and disease pools. Cancer antigens (CA), CA 125, CA 19.9, and CA 15.3, and carcinoembryonic antigen were measured in one set and in 217 women comprising six of the pelvic disease pools. Use of a set was illustrated for mesothelin (soluble mesothelin-related protein). Statistical output included concentration differences between pooled cases and controls (z values for single analytes; Mahalanobis distances for pairs), correlation between z values and sensitivities, coefficient of variations, and standardized biases. RESULTS: Marker concentrations in the six pelvic disease pools were generally within 0.25 SD of the actual average, and z values correlated well with sensitivities. CA 125 remains the best single marker for nonmucinous ovarian cancer, complemented by CA 15.3 or soluble mesothelin-related protein. There is no comparable breast cancer biomarker among the current analytes tested. CONCLUSION: The potential value of standard serum sets for initial assessment of candidate biomarkers is illustrated. Sets are now available through the Early Detection Research Network to evaluate biomarkers for women's cancers.},

Through simulations of a simple causal structure we investigate the degree to which instrumental variable (IV)-estimators may become biased in the context of exposures that affect survival. We observed that selecting on survival decreased instrument strength and, for exposures with directionally concordant effects on survival (and outcome), introduced downward bias of the IV-estimator when the exposures reduced the probability of survival till study inclusion. Higher ages at study inclusion generally increased this bias, particularly when the true causal effect was not equal to null. Moreover, the bias in the estimated exposure-outcome relation depended on whether the estimation was conducted in the one- or two-sample setting. Finally, we briefly discuss which statistical approaches might help to alleviate this and other types of selection bias. See video abstract at, http://links.lww.com/EDE/B589.},

Selection bias may be a problem in that some other cancers may be caused by the exposure under study biasing the odds ratio towards unity. Such bias is noted to be greatest with low prevalence exposures associated with high attributable risks for other cancers. However, it may be possible to identify selection bias with other cancer controls using census or other general population data. In addition, using other cancers as controls has important advantages with regard to recall and interviewer bias, which may be of unknown magnitude and direction when using general population controls. A further disadvantage of general population controls is that separate selection of decreased controls should usually be made for deceased cases, whereas a mixture of live and deceased controls can be expected when selecting other cancer patients as controls. Since there are also logistical and cost advantages in using other cancer patients as controls, this study design is likely to be used increasingly in the future, particularly in cancer registry settings.},

We investigated the drug's effect on overall survival after a median follow-up of 2 years in the Herceptin Adjuvant (HERA) study. Methods: HERA is an international multicentre randomised trial that compared 1 or 2 years of trastuzumab treatment with observation alone after standard neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy in women with HER2-positive node positive or high-risk node negative breast cancer. 5102 women participated in the trial; we analysed data from 1703 women who had been randomised for treatment with trastuzumab for 1 year and 1698 women from the control group, with median follow-up of 23{$\cdot$}5 months (range 0-48 months). The primary endpoint of the trial was disease-free survival. Here, we assess overall survival, a secondary endpoint. Analyses were done on an intent-to-treat basis. This trial is registered with the European Clinical Trials Database, number 2005-002385-11. Findings: 97 (5{$\cdot$}7\%) patients randomised to observation alone and 58 (3{$\cdot$}4\%) patients randomised to 1 year of treatment with trastuzumab were lost to follow-up. 172 women stopped trastuzumab prematurely. 59 deaths were reported for trastuzumab and 90 in the control group. The unadjusted hazard ratio (HR) for the risk of death with trastuzumab compared with observation alone was 0{$\cdot$}66 (95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}47-0{$\cdot$}91; p=0{$\cdot$}0115). 218 disease-free survival events were reported with trastuzumab compared with 321 in the control group. The unadjusted HR for the risk of an event with trastuzumab compared with observation alone was 0{$\cdot$}64 (0{$\cdot$}54-0{$\cdot$}76; p{$<$}0{$\cdot$}0001). Interpretation: Our results show that 1 year of treatment with trastuzumab after adjuvant chemotherapy has a significant overall survival benefit after a median follow-up of 2 years. The emergence of this benefit after only 2 years reinforces the importance of trastuzumab in the treatment of women with HER2-positive early breast cancer. \textcopyright{} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Background The regression discontinuity design (RDD) is a quasi-experimental approach used to avoid confounding bias in the assessment of new policies and interventions. It is applied specifically in situations where individuals are assigned to a policy/intervention based on whether they are above or below a pre-specified cut-off on a continuously measured variable, such as birth date, income or weight. The strength of the design is that, provided individuals do not manipulate the value of this variable, assignment to the policy/intervention is considered as good as random for individuals close to the cut-off. Despite its popularity in fields like economics, the RDD remains relatively unknown in epidemiology where its application could be tremendously useful. Methods In this paper, we provide a practical introduction to the RDD for health researchers, describe four empirically testable assumptions of the design and offer strategies that can be used to assess whether these assumptions are met in a given study. For illustrative purposes, we implement these strategies to assess whether the RDD is appropriate for a study of the impact of human papillomavirus vaccination on cervical dysplasia. Results We found that, whereas the assumptions of the RDD were generally satisfied in our study context, birth timing had the potential to confound our effect estimate in an unexpected way and therefore needed to be taken into account in the analysis. Conclusions Our findings underscore the importance of assessing the validity of the assumptions of this design, testing them when possible and making adjustments as necessary to support valid causal inference.},

Daily precipitation estimates were generated for each town based upon data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Odds ratio (OR) and 95\% confidence intervals (CI) for associations between extreme precipitation and ER visits for influenza were estimated using conditional logistic regression. Results: Extreme precipitation events were associated with an OR = 1.23 (95\%CI: 1.16, 1.30) for ER visits for influenza at lag days 0-6. There was significant effect modification by race, with the strongest association observed among Blacks (OR = 1.48 (1.30, 1.68)). Conclusions: We observed a positive association between extreme precipitation events and ER visits for influenza, particularly among Blacks. Our results suggest that influenza is associated with extreme precipitation in a temperate area; this association could be a result of disease ecology, behavioral changes such as indoor crowding, or both. Extreme precipitation events are expected to increase in the Northeastern United States as climate change progresses. Additional research exploring the basis of this association can inform potential interventions for extreme weather events and influenza transmission.},

  abstract = {When epidemiologic studies are conducted in a subset of the population, selection bias can threaten the validity of causal inference. This bias can occur whether or not that selected population is the target population, and can occur even in the absence of exposure-outcome confounding. However, it is often difficult to quantify the extent of selection bias, and sensitivity analysis can be challenging to undertake and to understand. In this article we demonstrate that the magnitude of the bias due to selection can be bounded by simple expressions defined by parameters characterizing the relationships between unmeasured factor(s) responsible for the bias and the measured variables. No functional form assumptions are necessary about those unmeasured factors. Using knowledge about the selection mechanism, researchers can account for the possible extent of selection bias by specifying the size of the parameters in the bounds. We also show that the bounds, which differ depending on the target population, result in summary measures that can be used to calculate the minimum magnitude of the parameters required to shift a risk ratio to the null. The summary measure can be used to determine the overall strength of selection that would be necessary to explain away a result. We then show that the bounds and summary measures can be simplified in certain contexts or with certain assumptions. Using examples with varying selection mechanisms, we also demonstrate how researchers can implement these simple sensitivity analyses.},

Sensitivity analysis methods allow researchers to assess the extent of this bias but are not always used. One particularly straightforward technique that requires minimal assumptions is nonetheless difficult to interpret, and so would benefit from a more intuitive parameterization. Methods: We conducted an exhaustive numerical search over simulated mediation effects, calculating the proportion of scenarios in which a bound for unmeasured mediator\textendash outcome confounding held under an alternative parameterization. Results: In over 99\% of cases, the bound for the bias held when we described the strength of confounding directly via the confounder\textendash mediator relationship instead of via the conditional exposure\textendash confounder relationship. Conclusions: Researchers can conduct sensitivity analysis using a method that describes the strength of the confounder\textendash outcome relationship and the approximate strength of the confounder\textendash mediator relationship that, together, would be required to explain away a direct or indirect effect.

  abstract = {Caregivers have lower mortality rates than noncaregivers in population-based studies, which contradicts the caregiver-stress model and raises speculation about selection bias influencing these findings. We examined possible selection bias due to 1) sampling decisions and 2) selective participation among women (baseline mean age = 79 years) in the Caregiver-Study of Osteoporotic Fractures (Caregiver-SOF) (1999-2009), an ancillary study to the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures (SOF). Caregiver-SOF includes 1,069 SOF participants (35\% caregivers) from 4 US geographical areas (Baltimore, Maryland; Minneapolis, Minnesota; the Monongahela Valley, Pennsylvania; and Portland, Oregon). Participants were identified by screening all SOF participants for caregiver status (1997-1999; n = 4,036; 23\% caregivers) and rescreening a subset of caregivers and noncaregivers matched on sociodemographic factors 1-2 years later. Adjusted hazard ratios related caregiving to 10-year mortality in all women initially screened, subsamples representing key points in constructing Caregiver-SOF, and Caregiver-SOF. Caregivers had better functioning than noncaregivers at each screening. The association between caregiving and mortality among women invited to participate in Caregiver-SOF (41\% died; adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) = 0.73, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.61, 0.88) was slightly more protective than that in all initially screened women (37\% died; aHR = 0.83, 95\% CI: 0.73, 0.95), indicating little evidence of selection bias due to sampling decisions, and was similar to that in Caregiver-SOF (39\% died; aHR = 0.71, 95\% CI: 0.57, 0.89), indicating no participation bias. These results add to a body of evidence that informal caregiving may impart health benefits.},

  abstract = {Unmeasured confounding, selection bias, and measurement error are well-known sources of bias in epidemiologic research. Methods for assessing these biases have their own limitations. Many quantitative sensitivity analysis approaches consider each type of bias individually, while more complex approaches are harder to implement or require numerous assumptions. By failing to consider multiple biases at once, researchers can underestimate -- or overestimate -- their joint impact. We show that it is possible to bound the total composite bias due to these three sources, and to use that bound to assess the sensitivity of a risk ratio to any combination of these biases. We derive bounds for the total composite bias under a variety of scenarios, providing researchers with tools to assess their total potential impact. We apply this technique to a study where unmeasured confounding and selection bias are both concerns, and to another study in which possible differential exposure misclassification and unmeasured confounding are concerns. We also show that a "multi-bias E-value" can describe the minimal strength of joint bias-parameter association necessary for an observed risk ratio to be compatible with a null causal effect (or with other pre-specified effect sizes). This may provide intuition about the relative impacts of each type of bias. The approach we describe is easy to implement with minimal assumptions, and we provide R functions to do so.},

Adopting a causal perspective that is implicit in much of the literature on the subject, the paper concludes that in many instances the effects do not admit the interpretations imparted in the literature. Drawing a distinction between concomitants and factors, the paper concludes that a concomitant has neither total nor direct effects on other variables. When a variable is a factor and one or more intervening variables are concomitants, the notion of a direct effect is not causally meaningful. Even when the notion of a direct effect is meaningful, the usual estimate of this quantity may be inappropriate. The total effect is usually interpreted as an equilibrium multiplier. In the case where there are simultaneity relations among the dependent variables in tghe model, the results in the literature for the total effects of dependent variables on other dependent variables are not equilibrium multipliers, and thus, the usual interpretation is incorrect. To remedy some of these deficiencies, a new effect, the total effect of a factorX on an outcomeY, holding a set of variablesF constant, is defined. When defined, the total and direct effects are a special case of this new effect, and the total effect of a dependent variable on a dependent variable is an equilibrium multiplier.},

  abstract = {The simcausal R package is a tool for specification and simulation of complex longitudinal data structures that are based on non-parametric structural equation models. The package aims to provide a flexible tool for simplifying the conduct of transparent and reproducible simulation studies, with a particular emphasis on the types of data and interventions frequently encountered in real-world causal inference problems, such as, observational data with time-dependent confounding, selection bias, and random monitoring processes. The package interface allows for concise expression of complex functional dependencies between a large number of nodes, where each node may represent a measurement at a specific time point. The package allows for specification and simulation of counterfactual data under various user-specified interventions (e.g., static, dynamic, deterministic, or stochastic). In particular, the interventions may represent exposures to treatment regimens, the occurrence or non-occurrence of right-censoring events, or of clinical monitoring events. Finally, the package enables the computation of a selected set of user-specified features of the distribution of the counterfactual data that represent common causal quantities of interest, such as, treatment-specific means, the average treatment effects and coefficients from working marginal structural models. The applicability of simcausal is demonstrated by replicating the results of two published simulation studies.},

  abstract = {Background Preterm birth, low birth weight, and infant catch-up growth seem associated with an increased risk of respiratory diseases in later life, but individual studies showed conflicting results. Objectives We performed an individual participant data meta-analysis for 147,252 children of 31 birth cohort studies to determine the associations of birth and infant growth characteristics with the risks of preschool wheezing (1-4 years) and school-age asthma (5-10 years). Methods First, we performed an adjusted 1-stage random-effect meta-analysis to assess the combined associations of gestational age, birth weight, and infant weight gain with childhood asthma. Second, we performed an adjusted 2-stage random-effect meta-analysis to assess the associations of preterm birth (gestational age {$<$}37 weeks) and low birth weight ({$<$}2500 g) with childhood asthma outcomes. Results Younger gestational age at birth and higher infant weight gain were independently associated with higher risks of preschool wheezing and school-age asthma (P {$<$}.05). The inverse associations of birth weight with childhood asthma were explained by gestational age at birth. Compared with term-born children with normal infant weight gain, we observed the highest risks of school-age asthma in children born preterm with high infant weight gain (odds ratio [OR], 4.47; 95\% CI, 2.58-7.76). Preterm birth was positively associated with an increased risk of preschool wheezing (pooled odds ratio [pOR], 1.34; 95\% CI, 1.25-1.43) and school-age asthma (pOR, 1.40; 95\% CI, 1.18-1.67) independent of birth weight. Weaker effect estimates were observed for the associations of low birth weight adjusted for gestational age at birth with preschool wheezing (pOR, 1.10; 95\% CI, 1.00-1.21) and school-age asthma (pOR, 1.13; 95\% CI, 1.01-1.27). Conclusion Younger gestational age at birth and higher infant weight gain were associated with childhood asthma outcomes. The associations of lower birth weight with childhood asthma were largely explained by gestational age at birth.},

  abstract = {STUDY QUESTION: Is academic performance in adolescents aged 15-16 years and conceived after ART, measured as test scores in ninth grade, comparable to that for spontaneously conceived (SC) adolescents? SUMMARY ANSWER: ART singletons had a significantly lower mean test score in the adjusted analysis when compared with SC singletons, yet the differences were small and probably not of clinical relevance. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Previous studies have shown similar intelligence quotient (IQ) levels in ART and SC children, but only a few have been on adolescents. Academic performance measured with standardized national tests has not previously been explored in a complete national cohort of adolescents conceived after ART. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: A Danish national registry-based cohort including all 4766 ART adolescents (n = 2836 singletons and n = 1930 twins) born in 1995-1998 were compared with two SC control cohorts: a randomly selected singleton population (n = 5660) and all twins (n = 7064) born from 1995 to 1998 in Denmark. Nine children who died during the follow-up period were excluded from the study. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Mean test scores on a 7-point-marking scale from -3 to 12 were compared, and adjustments were made for relevant reproductive and socio-demographic covariates including occupational and educational level of the parents. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: The crude mean test score was higher in both ART singletons and ART twins compared with SC adolescents. The crude mean differences were +0.41 (95\% CI 0.30-0.53) and +0.45 (95\% CI 0.28-0.62) between ART and SC singletons and between ART and SC twins, respectively. However, the adjusted mean overall test score was significantly lower for ART singletons compared with SC singletons (adjusted mean difference -0.15 (95\% CI -0.29-(-0.02))). For comparison, the adjusted mean difference was +2.05 (95\% CI 1.82-2.28) between the highest and the lowest parental educational level, suggesting that the effect of ART is weak compared with the conventional predictors. The adjusted analyses showed significantly lower mean test scores in mathematics and physics/chemistry for ART singletons compared with SC singletons. Comparing ART twins with SC twins yielded no difference in academic performance in the adjusted analyses. Similar crude and adjusted overall mean test scores were found when comparing ART singletons and ART twins. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Missing data on educational test scores occurred in 6.6\% of adolescents aged 15-16 years for the birth cohorts 1995-1997, where all of the children according to their age should have passed the ninth grade exam at the time of data retrieval. As sensitivity analyses yielded no significant difference in the adjusted risk of having missing test scores between any of the groups, it is unlikely that this should bias our results. Adjustment for body mass index and smoking during pregnancy was not possible. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: As our results are based on national data, our findings can be applied to other populations. The findings of this paper suggest that a possible small negative effect of parental subfertility or ART treatment is counterbalanced by the higher educational level in the ART parents.},

Design: Danish national registry-based cohort study. Setting: Danish national registries. Population: All 6495 singletons conceived after assisted reproductive technology (ART) treatment in Denmark from 1995 to 2001 [FET (n)~=~423; fresh ET (n)~=~6072]. Methods: Mean test scores on a national standardised and international comparable grading-scale. Comparisons of test score were first made in univariate analysis (Model 1) and secondly in a multivariate linear model (Model 2) adjusting for relevant reproductive and socio-demographic covariates such as the occupational and educational level of the parents. Sensitivity analyses on FET-IVF (in vitro fertilisation) versus fresh ET-IVF and FET-ICSI (intracytoplasmic sperm injection) versus fresh ET-ICSI were made. Linear mixed models were used to account for the correlation in test scores of siblings for continuous outcome. Main outcome measures: Mean overall test score and test score in Danish, mathematics, English, and physics/chemistry. Results: Crude and adjusted mean test scores were similar for adolescents conceived after FET compared with fresh ET. The crude mean difference was +0.11 (95\% CI -0.11; 0.34), and the adjusted mean difference was +0.12 (95\% CI -0.09; 0.34). Conclusions: Adolescents conceived after FET had similar academic performance at 15\textendash 16 of years of age compared with children conceived after fresh ET.

  abstract = {The AhR was initially identified as a ligand-activated transcription factor mediating effects of chlorinated dioxins and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons on cytochrome P450 1 (CYP1) expression. Recently, evidence supporting involvement of the AhR in cell-cycle regulation and tumorigenesis has been presented. To further define the roles of the AhR in cancer, we investigated the effects of AhR expression on cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and tumorigenesis of MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. In these studies, the properties of MCF-7 cells were compared with those of two MCF-7-derived sublines: AH(R100) , which express minimal AhR, and AhR(exp) , which overexpress AhR. Quantitative PCR, Western immunoblots, 17{$\beta$}-estradiol (E2 ) metabolism assays, and ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase assays showed the lack of AhR expression and AhR-regulated CYP1 expression in AH(R100) cells, and enhanced AhR and CYP1 expression in AhR(exp) cells. In the presence of 1\,nM E2 , rates of cell proliferation of the three cell lines showed an inverse correlation with the levels of AhR mRNA. In comparison with MCF-7 and AhR(exp) cells, AH(R100) cells produced more colonies in soft agar and showed enhanced migration and invasion in chamber assays with E2 as the chemoattractant. Despite the lack of significant AhR expression, AH(R100) cells retained the ability to form tumors in severe combined immunodeficient mice when supplemented with E2 , producing mean tumor volumes comparable to those observed with MCF-7 cells. These studies indicate that, while CYP1 expression and inducibility are highly dependent on AhR expression, the proliferation, invasion, migration, anchorage-independent growth, and estrogen-stimulated tumor formation of MCF-7 cells do not require the AhR. \textcopyright{} 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

With the goal of determining factors that control AHR gene expression, our studies are focused on the role of the short tandem repeat polymorphism, (GGGGC)n, located in the proximal promoter of the human AHR gene. When luciferase constructs containing varying GGGGC repeats were transfected into cancer cell lines derived from the lung, colon, and breast, the number of GGGGC repeats affected AHR promoter activity. The number of GGGGC repeats was determined in DNA from 327 humans and from 38 samples representing 5 species of non-human primates. In chimpanzees and 3 species of macaques, only (GGGGC)2 alleles were observed; however, in western gorilla, (GGGGC)n alleles with n=2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 were identified. In all human populations examined, the frequency of (GGGGC)n was n=4{$>$}5{$\gg$}2, 6. When frequencies of the (GGGGC)n alleles in DNA from patients with lung, colon, or breast cancer were evaluated, the occurrence of (GGGGC)2 was found to be 8-fold more frequent among lung cancer patients in comparison with its incidence in the general population, as represented by New York State neonates. Analysis of matched tumor and non-tumor DNA samples from the same individuals provided no evidence of microsatellite instability. These studies indicate that the (GGGGC)n short tandem repeats are inherited, and that the (GGGGC)2 allele in the AHR proximal promoter region should be further investigated with regard to its potential association with lung cancer susceptibility.},

Peripheral arterial disease (PAD), a manifestation of CVD and a marker for other adverse CVD outcomes such as ischemic heart disease and stroke, remains underrecognized and undertreated in women. Contrary to the previous belief that PAD is mainly a disease of white men, contemporary data suggest equal, if not higher, prevalence rates in nonwhite women. Women often present with asymptomatic or atypical disease and seek medical attention with more advanced disease. Cardiovascular morbidity and mortality rates, as well as procedural mortality rates, remain elevated in women compared with men. There are sex-specific markers and comorbidities with a higher female prevalence that are associated with PAD. Greater focus on PAD in cardiovascular trials, equivalent enrollment of women in large trials, and focused prevention strategies may help reduce the economic burden and adverse outcomes associated with PAD in women.},

There is currently limited data on the health of these children in later life as the techniques are relatively new. Certain trends have started to emerge with high order births proving to be responsible for a large proportion of premature and low-birth weight infants. The increased risk of perinatal morbidity and mortality associated with singleton births has been linked to the infertility of the couple rather than the techniques used. This theory has also been suggested to account for the increase in congenital malformations observed. No discrepancies in neurodevelopmental outcome of these children have been established and no detrimental psychological effects on the families have been reported. There has been an increase in childhood illness observed and the future fertility of these children is a major concern for many parents. Further follow up of these children is needed to fully establish the long-term health implications of in vitro fertilisation and intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Effects of labor force participation on mental health can be difficult to discern due to the possibility of selection bias. Previous research typically adjusts for direct selection (reverse causality) but ignores indirect selection (unmeasured confounders). METHODS: We investigate the relationship between men's employment transitions and mental health using a dynamic simultaneous equations model applied to data from the British Household Panel Survey (1991-2009). Outcome is self-reported distress and anxiety as summed on a 12-point scale. We allow for direct selection by allowing prior mental health to affect both subsequent mental health and employment transitions in the joint model. We adjust for indirect selection by allowing for residual correlation between mental health and employment. RESULTS: Moving from unemployment to employment was strongly associated with an improvement in mental health, whereas becoming unemployed was detrimental. However, these associations were attenuated by unmeasured confounders. After adjustment for indirect selection, the increased distress and anxiety associated with becoming unemployed decreased from 2.5 (95\% confidence interval = 2.2 to 2.7) to 2.2 (2.0 to 2.5). (A change of 2.5 equates to half a standard deviation on the 12-point scale.) The improvement with moving from unemployment to employment was also weakened slightly (from -2.1 [-2.4 to -1.7] to -1.8 [-2.1 to -1.5]). CONCLUSIONS: There was strong evidence of indirect selection, but less support for direct selection. Nevertheless, the effects on psychological health of transitions between employment and unemployment, and between employment and economic inactivity, remained substantial after adjusting for selection.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: There are challenges in delivering maternal and infant health (MIH) care to remote Northern Territory (NT) communities. These include fragmented care with birthing in regional hospitals resulting in cultural and geographical dislocation for Aboriginal women. Many NT initiatives are aimed at improving care. Indicators for evaluating these for remote Aboriginal mothers and infants need to be clearer. We reviewed existing indicators to inform a set of pragmatic indicators for reporting improvement in remote MIH care. METHODS: Scientific databases and grey literature (organisational websites and Google Scholar) were searched using the terms 'Aboriginal/maternal/infant/remote health/monitoring performance'. Key stakeholders identified omitted indicators sets. Relevant sets were reviewed and organised by indicator type, stage of patient journey, topic and theme. RESULTS: Forty-two indicators sets were found. Seven focused on Aboriginal health, 23 on reproductive/maternal health, eight on child/infant health and four on other aspects, e.g. remote health. We identified more than 1,000 individual indicators. Of these, 656 were relevant for our purpose and were subsequently organised into 300 topics and 16 themes for antenatal, birth and postpartum, and infant care by indicator type. CONCLUSION: There are many measures for monitoring health care delivery to mothers and infants. Few are framed around remote MIH services, despite poorer health outcomes of remote mothers and infants and the specific challenges with providing care in this setting. Establishing relevant indicators is vital to support relevant data collection and the development of appropriate policy for remote Aboriginal maternal and infant care.},

The study population consisted of 996 cases and 1,085 controls who had died in 1982-83 after applying for pensions. Next of kin provided information on smoking, work history, and other potential confounders. Work history data were also obtained from the Teamsters Union. While no single job category had a significant excess risk compared to the non-exposed group, certain sub-groups were elevated. The odds ratio for those with long-term employment as long-haul truckers after 1959 (an approximate date for the introduction of diesel engines) was 1.55 (95\{\%\} CI: 0.97, 2.47). Long-term drivers of primarily diesel trucks had an odds ratio of 1.89 (95\{\%\} CI: 1.04, 3.42). Overall, our results suggest that diesel truck drivers have an excess risk of lung cancer compared to other teamsters in jobs outside the trucking industry. However, our findings were not uniformly consistent and our data have many limitations, the most important of which is the lack of data on exposure to diesel fumes.},

  abstract = {Counter-intuitive associations appear frequently in epidemiology, and these results are often debated. In particular, several scenarios are characterized by a general risk factor that appears protective in particular subpopulations, for example, individuals suffering from a specific disease. However, the associations are not necessarily representing causal effects. Selection bias due to conditioning on a collider may often be involved, and causal graphs are widely used to highlight such biases. These graphs, however, are qualitative, and they do not provide information on the real life relevance of a spurious association. Quantitative estimates of such associations can be obtained from simple statistical models. In this study, we present several paradoxical associations that occur in epidemiology, and we explore these associations in a causal, frailty framework. By using frailty models, we are able to put numbers on spurious effects that often are neglected in epidemiology. We discuss several counter-intuitive findings that have been reported in real life analyses, and we present calculations that may expand the understanding of these associations. In particular, we derive novel expressions to explain the magnitude of bias in index-event studies.},

Recent data suggesting a role for the AHR in regulatory T-cell (Treg) and T-helper 17 (Th17) cell development have only added to the excitement about this biology. In this review, we will attempt to illustrate what is currently known about AHR biology in the hope that data from fields as diverse as evolutionary biology and pharmacology will help elucidate the mechanism by which AHR modifies immune responses. We also will discuss the complexities of AHR pharmacology and genetics that may influence future studies of AHR in the immune system.},

We examine differences between Australian couples with natural conceptions who agreed or declined to participate in such a study.METHODSWomen pregnant between 16 and 32 weeks gestation participating in a retrospective time to pregnancy (TTP) study were each requested to recruit their eligible (on the basis of age, place of his birth and of his mother's birth) male partner to complete additional questionnaires, have a physical examination and provide blood and two semen samples.RESULTSFrom 2061 women who completed the TTP questionnaire (response rate, 98) there were 928 eligible male partners of whom 225 (24) were responders. There were significant socio-demographic and self-reported exposure differences between responders and non-responders in particular, female professional occupation, knowledge of the fertile phase, pelvic inflammatory disease, non-smoker at time of conception and wine consumption per week were more frequent in the responders. There was no evidence of a bias for the subfertile being more likely to volunteer for the study. Mean TTP for planned pregnancies for responders and non-responders were 3.3 and 3.8 cycles (P = 0.319), respectively, and the cycle specific pregnancy rates were not significantly different after covariate adjustment by Cox regression.CONCLUSIONSThe present study confirms that participation rates are low in studies of semen quality. Although the expected higher participation of subfertile couples was not confirmed, there remains considerable potential for bias and other problems that could invalidate this type of study.},

  abstract = {Our objective was to evaluate whether infants born to obese or diabetic women are at higher risk of non-syndromic orofacial clefting. We conducted a population-based case-control study using Washington State birth certificate and hospitalisation data for the years 1987-2005. Cases were infants born with orofacial clefts (n = 2153) and controls infants without orofacial clefts (n = 18 070). The primary exposures were maternal obesity (body mass index {$\geq$}30) and diabetes (either pre-existing or gestational). We estimated adjusted odds ratios (ORs) to compare, for mothers of cases and controls, the proportions of obese vs. normal-weight women and diabetic vs. non-diabetic women. We additionally performed Monte Carlo-based simulation analysis to explore possible influences of biases. Obese women had a small increased risk of isolated orofacial clefts in their offspring compared with normal-body mass index women [adjusted OR 1.26; 95\% confidence interval 1.03, 1.55]. Results were similar regardless of type of cleft. Bias analyses suggest that estimates may represent underlying ORs of stronger magnitude. Results for diabetic women were highly imprecise and inconsistent. We and others have observed weak associations of similar magnitude between maternal obesity and risk of non-syndromic orofacial clefts. These results could be due to bias or residual confounding. However, it is also possible that these results represent a stronger underlying association. More precise exposure measurement could help distinguish between these two possibilities. \textcopyright{} 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To deal with the causal relationship between corporal punishment and antisocial behavior (ASB) by considering the level of ASB of the child at the start of the study. METHODS: Data from interviews with a national sample of 807 mothers of children aged 6 to 9 years in the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth-Child Supplement. Analysis of variance was used to test the hypothesis that when parents use corporal punishment to correct ASB, it increases subsequent ASB. The analysis controlled for the level of ASB at the start of the study, family socio-economic status, sex of the child, and the extent to which the home provided emotional support and cognitive stimulation. RESULTS: Forty-four percent of the mothers reported spanking their children during the week prior to the study and they spanked them an average of 2.1 times that week. The more spanking at the start of the period, the higher the level of ASB 2 years later. The change is unlikely to be owing to the child's tendency toward ASB or to confounding with demographic characteristics or with parental deficiency in other key aspects of socialization because those variables were statistically controlled. CONCLUSIONS: When parents use corporal punishment to reduce ASB, the long-term effect tends to be the opposite. The findings suggest that if parents replace corporal punishment by nonviolent modes of discipline, it could reduce the risk of ASB among children and reduce the level of violence in American society.},

Many patients randomly assigned to deferred ADT did not require ADT because they died before becoming symptomatic. The question arises whether serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels may be used to decide when to initiate ADT in PCa not suitable for local curative treatment. Methods: PSA data at baseline, PSA doubling time (PSADT) in patients receiving no ADT, and time to PSA relapse ({$>$}2 ng/ml) in patients whose PSA declined to {$<$}2 ng/ml within the first year after immediate ADT were analyzed in 939 eligible patients randomly assigned to immediate (n = 468) or deferred ADT (n = 471). Results: In both arms, patients with a baseline PSA {$>$} 50 ng/ml were at a {$>$} 3.5-fold higher risk to die of PCa than patients with a baseline PSA {$\leq$} 8 ng/ml. If baseline PSA was between 8 and 50 ng/ml, the risk of PCa death was approximately 7.5-fold higher in patients with PSADT {$<$} 12 mo than in patients with PSADT {$>$} 12 mo. Time to PSA relapse after response to immediate ADT correlated significantly with baseline PSA, suggesting that baseline PSA may also reflect disease aggressiveness. Conclusions: Patients with a baseline PSA {$>$} 50 ng/ml and/or a PSADT {$<$} 12 mo were at increased risk to die from PCa and might have benefited from immediate ADT, whereas patients with a baseline PSA {$<$} 50 ng/ml and a slow PSADT ({$>$}12 mo) were likely to die of causes unrelated to PCa, and thus could be spared the burden of immediate ADT. \textcopyright{} 2007 European Association of Urology.},

From the viewpoint of preventive medicine, factors influencing the development of obese children should be removed early in life.The purpose of this study was to the elucidate relationship between obesity in 3-year-old children and both behavioral and environmental factors by conducting a case-control study. Subjects were selected from the Toyama study. Matched-pair comparisons were performed between obese children whose Kaup's index was 18 or more (N=117) and control children (N=234) . Multivariate stepwised logistic regression analysis also applied to assess influence of confounding factors.The results indicated that the following 6 factors significantly influenced the development of obese 3-year-old children in exact Fisher's method analysis (p{$<$}0.05): person other than the mother responsible for taking care of the child, short sleep duration (9 hours or less), physical inactivity, eating snacks irregularly, overweight father (BMI{$\geq$}24), and overweight mother (BMI{$\geq$}24). For both sexes, after adjusting for confounders by multivariate stepwise logistic analysis, overweight mother (OR 2.54, 95 \% CI 1.64-3.95), birth overweight (birth weight{$\geq$}3,500g; OR 1.76, 95 \% CI 1.15-2.69), the mother not responsible for taking care of the child (OR 1.65, 95\% CI 1.10-2.48), overweight father (OR 1.62, 95\%CI 1.09-2.40), eating snacks irregularly (OR 1.56, 95\% CI 1.04-2.33), and gender (female;OR 0.51, 95\% CI 0.34-0.77) had significant relationships with obesity in childhood. For boys, overweight mother (OR 2.53, 95 \% CI 1.47-4.35), birth overweight (OR 2.03, 95\%CI 1.22-3.39), eating snacks irregularly (OR 1.94, 95 \%CI 1.19-3.18), and birth month (36-41 months; OR 0.47, 95 \% CI 0.23-0.96) had significant relationships. For girls, overweight mother (OR 2.62, 1.28-5.35), and short sleep duration (OR 2.24, 1.11-4.52) had significant relationships. In neither Fisher's exact method nor multivariate logistic models, time to wake up, bedtime, duration of playing outdoors, regularity of meals, care about salty food, or frequency of eating snacks had significant relations with obesity in 3-year-old children (p{$<$}0.05).},

  abstract = {Immortal time is a span of cohort follow-up during which, because of exposure definition, the outcome under study could not occur. Bias from immortal time was first identified in the 1970s in epidemiology in the context of cohort studies of the survival benefit of heart transplantation. It recently resurfaced in pharmacoepidemiology, with several observational studies reporting that various medications can be extremely effective at reducing morbidity and mortality. These studies, while using different cohort designs, all involved some form of immortal time and the corresponding bias. In this paper, the author describes various cohort study designs leading to this bias, quantifies its magnitude under different survival distributions, and illustrates it by using data from a cohort of lung cancer patients. The author shows that for time-based, event-based, and exposure-based cohort definitions, the bias in the rate ratio resulting from misclassified or excluded immortal time increases proportionately to the duration of immortal time. The bias is more pronounced with a decreasing hazard function for the outcome event, as illustrated with the Weibull distribution compared with a constant hazard from the exponential distribution. In conclusion, observational studies of drug benefit in which computerized databases are used must be designed and analyzed properly to avoid immortal time bias. \textcopyright{} The Author 2007.

  abstract = {Environmental agents including ethanol, 13-cis retinoic acid (RA, Accutane), the antimetabolite methotrexate, periods of hypoxia, ionizing radiation or hyperthermic stress, when administered acutely to pregnant experimental animals, induce stage-dependent craniofacial malformations comparable to those in corresponding human teratogen syndromes. Acute treatment regimens have allowed analysis of cell populations initially affected and subsequent dysmorphogenetic sequences as well as speculation relative to mechanisms of teratogenesis. In rodent models, ethanol and RA appear to affect similar cell populations and comparable malformations can be induced by both agents. When administered during gastrulation they cause a major insult to the anterior neural plate which results in characteristic ocular, brain and facial malformations comparable to those seen in the fetal alcohol syndrome. Exposure to these drugs at a time just prior to and during neural crest cell migration into the craniofacial and cervical regions results in malformations comparable to those seen in the Di-George sequence and/or retinoic acid embryopathy. Slightly later, at the time that the epibranchial placodes are active, insult results in mandibulofacial dysostosis-like syndromes. We propose that the pattern of these malformations is related to the particular vulnerability of cells in the vicinity of normal programmed cell death. Cell death is also associated with ionizing radiation and hyperthermia-induced malformations. Both of these teratogens are particularly damaging to the early development of the eye and central nervous system. Teratogenic temperature elevations result in arrest of mitotic activity and death of cells in mitosis. Hypoxia is also associated with cell death in specific regions and subsequent malformation. For example, death of cells in the invaginating olfactory placode has recently been associated with cleft lip formation. The relationship of hypoxia-induced cell death to energy requirements is being explored. Acute treatment with methotrexate results in frontonasal dysplasia (median facial clefts). Combined effects of fluid imbalance, lack of proliferation or death of frontonasal mesenchyme appear to be involved. Although the mechanisms of craniofacial malformation are complex, a common feature for many is excessive cell death for which the embryo may be unable to compensate. Excessive cell death in regions of programmed cell death represents an important, yet little appreciated, mechanism of teratogenesis.},

As a result, the viruses circulating change within and between seasons, and the composition of the influenza vaccine is updated annually. Thus, estimation of the vaccine's effectiveness is not constant across seasons. In order to provide annual estimates of the influenza vaccine's effectiveness, health departments have increasingly adopted the "test-negative design," using enhanced data from routine surveillance systems. In this design, patients presenting to participating general practitioners with influenza-like illness are swabbed for laboratory testing; those testing positive for influenza virus are defined as cases, and those testing negative form the comparison group. Data on patients' vaccination histories and confounder profiles are also collected. Vaccine effectiveness is estimated from the odds ratio comparing the odds of testing positive for influenza among vaccinated patients and unvaccinated patients, adjusting for confounders. The test-negative design is purported to reduce bias associated with confounding by health-care-seeking behavior and misclassification of cases. In this paper, we use directed acyclic graphs to characterize potential biases in studies of influenza vaccine effectiveness using the test-negative design. We show how studies using this design can avoid or minimize bias and where bias may be introduced with particular study design variations.},

Our goal was to estimate the association of maternal smoking behavior with spontaneous abortion while adjusting for numerous confounders. At the same time, we did not necessarily wish to evaluate the joint distribution among potentially unobserved covariates, which is seldom the subject of substantive scientific interest. The inverse probability weighting (IPW) approach preserves the semiparametric structure of the underlying model of substantive interest and clearly separates the model of substantive interest from the model used to account for the missing data. However, IPW often will not result in valid inference if the missing-data pattern is nonmonotone, even if the data are missing at random. We describe a recently proposed approach to modeling nonmonotone missing-data mechanisms under missingness at random to use in constructing the weights in IPW complete-case estimation, and we illustrate the approach using 3 data sets described in a companion article (Am J Epidemiol. 2018;187(3):568-575).},

  abstract = {Missing data occur frequently in empirical studies in the health and social sciences, and can compromise our ability to obtain valid inference. An outcome is said to be missing not at random (MNAR) if, conditional on the observed variables, the missing data mechanism still depends on the unobserved outcome. In such settings, identification is generally not possible without imposing additional assumptions. Identification is sometimes possible, however, if an instrumental variable (IV) is observed for all subjects that satisfies the exclusion restriction that the IV affects the missingness process without directly influencing the outcome. In this paper, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for nonparametric identification of the full data distribution under MNAR with the aid of an IV. In addition, we give sufficient identification conditions that are more straightforward to verify in practice. For inference, we focus on estimation of a population outcome mean, for which we develop a suite of semiparametric estimators that extend methods previously developed for data missing at random. Specifically, we propose a novel doubly robust estimator of the mean of an outcome subject to MNAR. For illustration, the methods are used to account for selection bias induced by HIV testing refusal in the evaluation of HIV seroprevalence in Mochudi, Botswana, using interviewer characteristics such as gender, age and years of experience as IVs.},

These quantities do not necessarily approximate one another, and the etiologic fraction is not generally estimable without strong biologic assumptions. In previous studies, researchers have explained the relations between excess and etiologic fractions in the potential-outcome framework, and few authors have explained the relations between these concepts by showing the correspondence between the potential-outcome model and the sufficient-cause model. In this article, the authors thoroughly clarify the conceptual relations between excess, attributable, and etiologic fractions by explicating the correspondence between these 2 models. In so doing, the authors take into account the potential completion time of each sufficient cause, which contributes to further insight to clarify the 2 types of etiologic fraction, i.e., accelerating etiologic proportion and total etiologic proportion. These 2 measures cannot be distinguished in epidemiologic data, and the differences might be subtle. However, they are closely related to a very fundamental issue of causal inference, that is, how researchers define etiology. Further, the authors clarify the relation between 3 distinct assumptions-positive monotonicity, no preventive action (or sufficient-cause positive monotonicity), and no preventive sequence.},

We aimed to estimate the proportion of all fetuses with birth defects terminated in the second trimester of pregnancy-overall and for specific defects.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nMETHODS: The study comprised all pregnancies ending in a singleton birth, miscarriage, or termination of pregnancy for which health care services were sought, as recorded in Danish medical registries between 1 January 2007 and 31 December 2011.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nRESULTS: Of the 420,090 pregnancies, 307,637 fetuses survived until gestational week 12 or beyond; of these, 296,373 (96\%) ended in a live birth or stillbirth and 11,264 (4\%) ended in a second-trimester termination. The prevalence of birth defects among live births and stillbirths was 3\% (9,790/296,373); the corresponding prevalence among second-trimester-terminated pregnancies was 14\% (1,563/11,264). Although only 4\% of all pregnancies ended in a second-trimester termination, 14\% (1,563/11,353) of pregnancies with birth defects were ended by a second-trimester termination. The groups of birth defects with the highest proportion of second-trimester terminations were defects of the nervous system (347/740; 48\%) and abdominal wall (58/149; 39\%).

Studies using these methods often compare 2 particular treatments, and the researchers perform their IV analyses conditional on patients' receiving this subset of treatments (while ignoring the third option of neither treatment). The ensuing selection bias that occurs due to this restriction has gone relatively unnoticed in interpretations and discussions of these studies' results. In this paper we describe the structure of this selection bias with examples drawn from commonly proposed instruments such as calendar time and preference, illustrate the bias with causal diagrams, and estimate the magnitude and direction of possible bias using simulations. A noncausal association between the proposed instrument and the outcome can occur in analyses restricted to patients receiving a subset of the possible treatments. This results in bias in the numerator for the standard IV estimator; the bias is amplified in the treatment effect estimate. The direction and magnitude of the bias in the treatment effect estimate are functions of the distribution of and relationships between the proposed instrument, treatment values, unmeasured confounders, and outcome. IV methods used to compare a subset of treatment options are prone to substantial biases, even when the proposed instrument appears relatively strong.},

One concern is whether a proposed analysis plan can address the realities of the differences between the available non-randomized observational study and the target trial. When large or unknown sources of unmeasured confounding are suspected, investigators might consider turning to instrumental variable (IV) methods. Of course, the interpretation and appropriateness of IV analyses need to be considered carefully. The purpose of this review is to summarize recent methodologic advancements in how epidemiologists weigh the validity of an IV analysis and to place these methodologic advancements in the context of the feasible target trial's protocol components. Recent findings There have been increased development and application of tools for sensitivity analyses, falsification strategies, and the identification of previously overlooked problems with IV analyses as applied in pharmacoepidemiology. Many of these recent insights can be seen as articulating restrictions on or tradeoffs between the types of target trials that can be validly emulated when using a classical IV analysis. Summary Putting classical IV methods in the context of target trials underscores the importance of recent methodologic developments and, more generally, when and how an IV analysis would be appropriate. We see that some tradeoffs in defining the target trials are unavoidable, that some tradeoffs may be offset or explored via sensitivity analyses, and that this serves as a framework for scientific discourse regarding IV and non-IV results emulating potentially different trials with different tradeoffs.},

The aim of the present study was to evaluate these two processes in women with endometriosis who had been treated with danazol to determine the sensitivity of a non-invasive test in diagnosing endometriosis. The clinical follow-up study was conducted in a group of 103 women diagnosed laparoscopically with endometriosis. Thirty-five patients qualified for danazol treatment. Pain was assessed using a visual analogue scale, whereas endometriosis was assessed using the revised American Society of Reproductive Medicine (rASRM) scale. Cancer antigen (CA)-125 and C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations in plasma and peritoneal fluid were determined by immunoenzymatic methods, whereas vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and interleukin (IL)-1{$\beta$} concentrations in plasma and peritoneal fluid were determined by ELISA. Endometrial expression of IL-8 and platelet-derived growth factor alpha polypeptide (PDGF-A) was determined using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Women with endometriosis (68.9\% of patients) had higher plasma concentrations of CA-125, as well as higher concentrations of both CA-125 and VEGF in the peritoneal fluid. Endometrial expression of IL-8 mRNA was significantly higher, whereas that of PDGF-A was significantly lower, in contrast. After danazol treatment the patients reported lower pain scores; in addition, CA-125 concentrations in the plasma were decreased (P{$<$}0.001), whereas VEGF concentration in the plasma increased (P=0.009). For the diagnosis of endometriosis, none of the combinations of given markers had a sensitivity {$>$}60\%. Danazol treatment is highly effective in relieving pain and decreasing CA-125 concentrations in the plasma. Higher plasma concentrations of VEGF after treatment could imply stimulation of angiogenesis.},

  abstract = {In diverse fields of empirical research\textemdash including many in the biological sciences\textemdash attempts are made to decom-pose the effect of an exposure on an outcome into its effects via a number of different pathways. For example, we may wish to separate the effect of heavy alcohol consumption on systolic blood pressure (SBP) into effects via body mass index (BMI), via gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), and via other pathways. Much progress has been made, mainly due to contributions from the field of causal inference, in understanding the precise nature of statistical estimands that capture such intuitive effects, the assumptions under which they can be identified, and statistical methods for doing so. These contributions have focused almost entirely on settings with a single mediator, or a set of mediators considered en bloc; in many applications, how-ever, researchers attempt a much more ambitious decomposition into numerous path-specific effects through many mediators. In this article, we give counterfactual definitions of such path-specific estimands in settings with multiple mediators, when earlier mediators may affect later ones, showing that there are many ways in which decomposition can be done. We discuss the strong assumptions under which the effects are identified, suggesting a sensitivity analysis approach when a particular subset of the assumptions cannot be justified. These ideas are illustrated using data on alcohol consumption, SBP, BMI, and GGT from the Izhevsk Family Study. We aim to bridge the gap from " single mediator theory " to " multiple mediator practice, " highlighting the ambitious nature of this endeavor and giving practical suggestions on how to proceed. 1. Introduction Exploring the relative strength of different pathways from an exposure to an outcome is a topic that has interested scien-tists across diverse fields for many decades. Early literature (Wright, 1921) through to the 1980s (Bentler, 1980; Baron and Kenny, 1986) focused on path analytic approaches, based on linear regression and structural equation models (SEMs). Under stringent parametric constraints, particular combina-tions of parameters from these models were taken to represent path-specific effects. Starting with Robins and Greenland (1992), then Pearl (2001), followed by an explosion of recent contributions (see Ten Have and Joffe, 2012, and references therein, and more recent articles by VanderWeele and coauthors), the formal language and estimation methods from the field of causal in-ference have shone light on this problem and widened the scope of such analyses, under more explicit assumptions. Robins and Greenland (1992) and Pearl (2001) used poten-tial outcomes (Neyman, 1923; Rubin, 1978) to give model-free definitions of direct and indirect effect estimands. Informally, a direct effect acts around a mediating variable of interest, whereas the indirect effect acts through this mediator; " di-rect " thus refers to all other pathways other than through the mediator being considered. The mediator could be mul-tivariate, but if so its constituent variables are considered en bloc: the direct effect acts around them all, and the indirect effect is through at least one of them without being further disentangled (Figure 1A). In a setting with two mediators, M 1 and M 2 (see Fig-ure 1B), there are four possible pathways from exposure (X) to outcome (Y): through M 1 alone, through M 2 alone, through both and through neither. In this article, our primary aim is to express the total causal effect of X on Y as the sum of separate effects along each of the possible pathways: the finest possible decomposition. The existing literature on multiple ({$>$}2) pathways from exposure to outcome can be character-ized as follows; either (1) M 2 is the mediator of interest, and M 1 is treated as a mediator\textendash outcome confounder affected by exposure, leading to a coarser two-way decomposition into an effect (indirect) through M 2 and an effect (direct) not through M 2 (Tchetgen Tchetgen and Shpitser, 2012; Vansteelandt and VanderWeele, 2013; VanderWeele and Chiba, 2014; Vander-Weele, Vansteelandt, and Robins, 2014), (2) path-specific effects are estimated, but not in such a way that their sum equals the total causal effect (Avin, Shpitser, and Pearl, 2005; Albert and Nelson, 2011), and (3) the multiple mediators do not causally affect one another (MacKinnon, 2000; Preacher and Hayes, 2008), that is, the arrow from M 1 to M 2 in Figure 1B is assumed absent, reducing the number of path-specific effects to three. Imai and Yamamoto (2013) fall into all three categories in different sections of their article, but at no point discuss the finest possible decomposition of the total causal effect in the presence of the arrow from M 1 to M 2 . The outline for the remainder of the article is as follows. In Section 2 we briefly review mediation estimands in the single mediator setting. In Section 3 we give our proposed},

  abstract = {Objective: The aim of this study was to collect and analyze data from different sources to have a general overview of COVID-19-related maternal deaths in Brazil, as well as to compare data with worldwide reports. Study design: We systematically searched data about COVID-19 maternal deaths from the Brazilian Ministry of Health surveillance system, State Departments of Health epidemiological reports, and media coverage. Data about timing of symptom onset and death (pregnancy or postpartum), gestational age, mode of birth, maternal age, comorbidities and/or risk factors, date of death, and place of death were retrieved when available. Results: We identified 20 COVID-19-related maternal deaths, age range 20\textendash 43 years. Symptoms onset was reported as on pregnancy for 12 cases, postpartum for 3 cases, and during the cesarean section for 1 case (missing data for 4). In 16 cases, death occurred in the postpartum period. At least one comorbidity or risk factor was present in 11 cases (missing data for 4). Asthma was the most common risk factor (5/11). Ten cases occurred in the Northeast region, and nine cases occurred in the Southeast region (5 of them in S\~ao Paulo, the first epicenter of COVID-19 in the country). Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest available series of maternal deaths due to COVID-19. Barriers to access healthcare, differences in pandemic containment measures in the country and high prevalence of concomitant risk factors for COVID-19 severe disease may play a role in the observed disparity compared to worldwide reports on maternal outcomes.},

  abstract = {Background: Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) constitute a major public health problem affecting one in 68 children. There is little understanding of the causes of ASD despite its serious social impact. Air pollution contains many toxicants known to have adverse effects on the fetus. We conducted a population based case-control study in southwestern Pennsylvania to estimate the association between ASD and 2005 US EPA modeled NATA (National Air Toxics Assessment) levels for 30 neurotoxicants. Methods: A total of 217 ASD cases born between 2005 and 2009 were recruited from local ASD diagnostic and treatment centers. There were two different control groups: 1) interviewed controls (N{$\in$}={$\in$}224) frequency matched by child's year of birth, sex and race with complete residential histories from prior to pregnancy through the child's second birthday, and 2) 5,007 controls generated from a random sample of birth certificates (BC controls) using residence at birth. We used logistic regression analysis comparing higher to first quartile of exposure to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95 \% confidence intervals (CI), adjusting for mother's age, education, race, smoking status, child's year of birth and sex. Results: Comparing fourth to first quartile exposures for all births, the adjusted OR for styrene was 2.04 (95 \% CI{$\in$}={$\in$}1.17-3.58, p{$\in$}={$\in$}0.013) for the interviewed case-control analysis and 1.61 (95 \% CI{$\in$}={$\in$}1.08-2.40, p{$\in$}={$\in$}0.018) for the BC analysis. In the BC comparison, chromium also exhibited an elevated OR of 1.60 (95 \% CI{$\in$}={$\in$}1.08-2.38, p{$\in$}={$\in$}0.020), which was similarly elevated in the interviewed analysis (OR{$\in$}={$\in$}1.52, 95 \% CI{$\in$}={$\in$}0.87-2.66). There were borderline significant ORs for the BC comparison for methylene chloride (OR{$\in$}={$\in$}1.41, 95 \% CI{$\in$}={$\in$}0.96-2.07, p{$\in$}={$\in$}0.082) and PAHs (OR{$\in$}={$\in$}1.44, 95 \% CI{$\in$}={$\in$}0.98-2.11, p{$\in$}={$\in$}0.064). Conclusions: Living in areas with higher levels of styrene and chromium during pregnancy was associated with increased risk of ASD, with borderline effects for PAHs and methylene chloride. These results are consistent with other studies. It is unclear, however, whether these chemicals are risk factors themselves or if they reflect the effect of a mixture of pollutants. Future work should include improved spatiotemporal estimates of exposure to air toxics, taking into account the dynamic movement of individuals during daily life.},

However, the link between childhood psychosocial factors, such as childhood adversities or parental SES, and metabolic disturbances is less well established. In addition, the lifetime perspective including adult socioeconomic factors remains of further interest.We carried out a systematic review with the main question if there is evidence in population- or community-based studies that childhood adversities (like neglect, traumata and deprivation) have considerable impact on type 2 diabetes incidence and other metabolic disturbances. Also, parental SES was included in the search as risk factor for both, diabetes and adverse childhood experiences. Finally, we assumed that obesity might be a mediator for the association of childhood adversities with diabetes incidence. Therefore, we carried out a second review on obesity, applying a similar search strategy. Two systematic reviews were carried out. Longitudinal, population- or community-based studies were included if they contained data on psychosocial factors in childhood and either diabetes incidence or obesity risk. We included ten studies comprising a total of 200,381 individuals. Eight out of ten studies indicated that low parental status was associated with type 2 diabetes incidence or the development of metabolic abnormalities. Adjustment for adult SES and obesity tended to attenuate the childhood SES-attributable risk but the association remained. For obesity, eleven studies were included with a total sample size of 70,420 participants. Four out of eleven studies observed an independent association of low childhood SES on the risk for overweight and obesity later in life. Taken together, there is evidence that childhood SES is associated with type 2 diabetes and obesity in later life. The database on the role of psychological factors such as traumata and childhood adversities for the future risk of type 2 diabetes or obesity is too small to draw conclusions. Thus, more population-based longitudinal studies and international standards to assess psychosocial factors are needed to clarify the mechanisms leading to the observed health disparities.},

  abstract = {This study applied nonparametric loess regression to describe the predictive association between birth weight and cognitive ability in childhood and generalized propensity score methods to control the confounding of multiple covariates that summarize prenatal differences. The data from wave one of the National Longitudinal Study of Youth 1979-Children (NLSY-C) and the data from wave one of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics-Child Development Supplement (PSID-CDS) were analyzed in parallel and the results were compared. Analysis of the two datasets proceeded in two stages. At the first stage, the association between birth weight and cognitive ability was examined first using loess regression models in which both birth weight and gestational age were the predictors, and then by simple loess regression models in which birth weight was the sole predictor while gestational age was restricted to the normal range, i.e., between 37 complete weeks (259 days) and 42 complete weeks (294 days) to help control its confounding effects. The association was examined separately for subsamples defined by race and sex. At the second stage, the distribution of birth weight was broken into low, medium, and high, and the challenge of controlling multiple covariates was addressed by stratifying the three groups on the balancing score estimated from generalized propensity score models that can accommodate more than two groups. The shape of the association between birth weight and cognitive ability as depicted by loess regression was not consistent across the two datasets. Among the children in the NLSY-C who were born near term and with normal birth weights, the association had an upside-down U-shape. Among the children in the PSID-CDS who were born near term and with normal birth weights, the association was roughly a continuously increasing one. The shape of the association persisted, and was slightly strengthened when multiple covariates that account for prenatal differences were controlled by balancing score-based stratification. Results from the two data sets demonstrated consistent racial and gender differences. The association was stronger for whites than for blacks. White males had slightly higher cognitive scores than white females, while black females had slightly higher scores than black males. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)},

Study subjects consist of 3,412 US children aged 60-83~months from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 Mother and Child Survey. Cognitive test scores using the Peabody Individual Achievement Test reading recognition and mathematics tests were used as the outcomes of interest. Association with maternal prepregnancy obesity was examined using the ordinary least square regression controlling for intrauterine, family background, maternal and child factors. Children of obese women had 3 points (0.23 SD units) lower peabody individual achievement test (PIAT) reading recognition score (p~=~0.007), and 2 points (0.16 SD units) lower PIAT mathematics scores (p~{$<~$}0.0001), holding all other factors constant. As expected, cognitive test score was associated with stimulating home environment (reading: {$\beta~$}=~0.15, p~{$<~$}0.0001, and math: {$\beta~$}=~0.15, p~{$<~$}0.0001), household income (reading: {$\beta~$}=~0.03, p~=~0.02 and math: {$\beta~$}=~0.04, p~=~0.004), maternal education (reading: {$\beta~$}=~0.42, p~=~0.0005, and math: {$\beta~$}=~0.32, p~=~0.008), and maternal cognitive skills (reading: {$\beta~$}=~0.11, p~{$<~$}0.0001, and math: {$\beta~$}=~0.09, p~{$<~$}0.0001). There was a significant association between maternal prepregnancy obesity and child cognitive test scores that could not be explained by other intrauterine, family background, maternal, and child factors. Children who live in disadvantaged postnatal environments may be most affected by the effects of maternal prepregnancy obesity. Replications of the current study using different cohorts are warranted to confirm the association between maternal prepregnancy obesity and child cognitive test scores.},

The authors examined the association between prepregnancy obesity and children's behavioral problems and if the association would differ by race. METHODS: This observational study used a total of 3395 white (n = 2127) and African-American (n = 1268) children aged 96 to 119 months from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth. Behavior Problem Index (BPI) total and subscale scores were used to measure children's behavioral problems. The association between maternal prepregnancy obesity and the BPI scores for each racial group was examined using multivariate linear and logistic regressions, controlling for prenatal, child, maternal, and family background factors. RESULTS: Maternal prepregnancy obesity was independently associated with an increase in the BPI total scores among the white sample only. Among the African-Americans, prepregnancy obesity was not associated with the BPI scores. Subsample analyses using externalizing and internalizing subscales also revealed similar trends. Among the white sample, children born to obese women were more socially disadvantaged than those born to nonobese women, whereas no such trend was observed in children of African-American obese and nonobese women. CONCLUSION: The impact of maternal prepregnancy obesity on children's behavioral problems differed by racial groups. Obesity-related metabolic dysregulations during the intrauterine period may not contribute to later children's behavioral problems. Social and psychological factors seem to play key roles in the association between prepregnancy obesity and childhood behavioral problems among whites.},

Cases were women from the cohort diagnosed with breast cancer between 1984 and 1994.

We categorized 463 cases and 2,201 controls according to history of induced abortion as recorded on the index birth certificate. The risk of breast cancer was not found to be associated with a prior induced abortion (estimated relative risk (RR) = 0.9, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.7-1.2).

Design: Data from the UK general practice research database (GPRD) were used to replicate previously performed randomised controlled trials, to the extent that was feasible aside from randomisation. Studies: Six published randomised controlled trials. Main outcome measure: Cardiovascular outcomes analysed by hazard ratios calculated with standard biostatistical methods and a new analytical technique, prior event rate ratio (PERR) adjustment. Results: In nine of 17 outcome comparisons, there were no significant differences between results of randomised controlled trials and database studies analysed using standard biostatistical methods or PERR analysis. In eight comparisons, Cox adjusted hazard ratios in the database differed significantly from the results of the randomised controlled trials, suggesting unmeasured confounding. In seven of these eight, PERR adjusted hazard ratios differed significantly from Cox adjusted hazard ratios, whereas in five they didn't differ significantly, and in three were more similar to the hazard ratio from the randomised controlled trial, yielding PERR results more similar to the randomised controlled trial than Cox (P{$<$}0.05). Conclusions: Although observational studies using databases are subject to unmeasured confounding, our new analytical technique (PERR), applied here to cardiovascular outcomes, worked well to identify and reduce the effects of such confounding. These results suggest that electronic medical record databases can be useful to investigate therapeutic effectiveness.},

The parametric g-formula, which appropriately adjusts for time-varying confounders affected by prior exposures, is especially well suited to estimating effects when the intervention involves multiple factors (joint interventions) or when the intervention involves decisions that depend on the value of evolving time-dependent factors (dynamic interventions). We describe the parametric g-formula, and use it to estimate the effect of various hypothetical lifestyle interventions on the risk of CHD using data from the Nurses' Health Study. Over the period 1982-2002, the 20-year risk of CHD in this cohort was 3.50\%. Under a joint intervention of no smoking, increased exercise, improved diet, moderate alcohol consumption and reduced body mass index, the estimated risk was 1.89\% (95\% confidence interval: 1.46-2.41). We discuss whether the assumptions required for the validity of the parametric g-formula hold in the Nurses' Health Study data. This work represents the first large-scale application of the parametric g-formula in an epidemiologic cohort study.},

  abstract = {In longitudinal studies, outcomes ascertained at follow-up are typically undefined for individuals who die prior to the follow-up visit. In such settings, outcomes are said to be truncated by death and inference about the effects of a point treatment or exposure, restricted to individuals alive at the follow-up visit, could be biased even if as in experimental studies, treatment assignment were randomized. To account for truncation by death, the survivor average causal effect (SACE) defines the effect of treatment on the outcome for the subset of individuals who would have survived regardless of exposure status. In this paper, the author nonparametrically identifies SACE by leveraging post-exposure longitudinal correlates of survival and outcome that may also mediate the exposure effects on survival and outcome. Nonparametric identification is achieved by supposing that the longitudinal data arise from a certain nonparametric structural equations model and by making the monotonicity assumption that the effect of exposure on survival agrees in its direction across individuals. A novel weighted analysis involving a consistent estimate of the survival process is shown to produce consistent estimates of SACE. A data illustration is given, and the methods are extended to the context of time-varying exposures. We discuss a sensitivity analysis framework that relaxes assumptions about independent errors in the nonparametric structural equations model and may be used to assess the extent to which inference may be altered by a violation of key identifying assumptions. \textcopyright{} 2014 The Authors.

  abstract = {Abstract: In perinatal epidemiology, birth outcomes such as small for gestational age (SGA) may not be observed for a pregnancy end- ing with a stillbirth. It is then said that SGA is truncated by stillbirth, which may give rise to survival bias when evaluating the effects on SGA of an exposure known also to influence the risk of a stillbirth. In this article, we consider the causal effects of maternal infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) on the risk of SGA, in a sample of pregnant women in Botswana. We hypothesize that previ- ously estimated effects of HIV on SGA may be understated because they fail to appropriately account for the over-representation of live births among HIV negative mothers, relative to HIV positive moth- ers. A simple yet novel regression-based approach is proposed to adjust effect estimates for survival bias for an outcome that is either continuous or binary. Under certain straightforward assumptions, the approach produces an estimate that may be interpreted as the survivor average causal effect of maternal HIV, which is, the aver- age effect of maternal HIV on SGA among births that would be live irrespective of maternal HIV status. The approach is particularly appealing, because it recovers an exposure effect which is robust to survival bias, even if the association between the risk of SGA and that of a stillbirth cannot be completely explained by adjusting for observed shared risk factors. The approach also gives a formal statistical test of the null hypothesis of no survival bias in the regres- sion framework.},

  abstract = {Agriculture can be an important engine of growth and poverty reduction. But the sector is underperforming in many countries in part because women, who are often a crucial resource in agriculture and the rural economy, face constraints that reduce their productivity. In this paper we draw on the available empirical evidence to study in which areas and to what degree women participate in agriculture. Aggregate data shows that women comprise about 43 percent of the agricultural labour force globally and in developing countries. But this figure masks considerable variation across regions and within countries according to age and social class. Time use surveys, which are more comprehensive but typically not nationally representative, add further insight into the substantial heterogeneity among countries and within countries in women's contribution to agriculture. They show that female time-use in agriculture varies also by crop, production cycle, age and ethnic group. A few time-use surveys have data by activity and these show that in general weeding and harvesting were predominantly female activities. Overall the labour burden of rural women exceeds that of men, and includes a higher proportion of unpaid household responsibilities related to preparing food and collecting fuel and water. The contribution of women to agricultural and food production is significant but it is impossible to verify empirically the share produced by women. Women's participation in rural labour markets varies considerably across regions, but invariably women are over represented in unpaid, seasonal and part-time work, and the available evidence suggests that women are often paid less than men, for the same work. Available data on rural and agricultural feminization shows that this is not a general trend but mainly a sub-Saharan Africa phenomena, as well as observed in some sectors such as unskilled labour in the fruit, vegetable and cut-flower export sector. This paper re-affirms that women make essential contributions to agriculture and rural enterprises across the developing world. But there is much diversity in women's roles and over-generalization undermines policy relevance and planning. The context is important and policies must be based on sound data and gender analysis.},

  abstract = {Purpose: To examine the relationship between body mass index (BMI), body weight perception (BWP), and indicators of internalizing and externalizing distress and social, attention and thought problems in a large representative sample of Dutch youth. Methods: A total of 1826 pupils in the eighth grade of primary education and 5730 students in the first four years of secondary education gave their height and weight to obtain an estimate of their BMI. They reported their evaluation of their body weight and completed Achenbach's Youth Self-Report (YSR) (1991), which assesses eight types of problem behavior. Data were analyzed in a multivariate framework with BMI and BWP as predictors and the YSR scores on different kinds of problem behavior as dependent variables, controlling for background characteristics. Results: Both BMI and BWP are associated with internalizing and externalizing problem behavior, and social, attention and thought problems. Multivariate tests show that BWP is more closely linked to problem behavior than BMI. Adolescents who were either underweight or overweight but considered themselves in good shape had no more problems than the group with normal BMI and BWP 'good'. The perception of being 'too thin' and particularly the perception of being 'too heavy' best predict problem behavior in both male and female adolescents. Overweight youngsters with an adequate perception of their weight have less somatic complaints than their normal-weight peers who perceive themselves as too heavy, but they show higher withdrawnness, social problems, and anxiety/depression. Conclusions: Adolescent girls are more dissatisfied with their weight than boys; however, the relationship between weight perception and problem behavior is the same for both genders. ?? 2006 Society for Adolescent Medicine.},

Advances in screening methods have improved the early diagnosis, prognosis, and survival for some cancers. Several validated biomarkers are currently used to diagnose and monitor the progression of cancer, but none of them shows adequate specificity, sensitivity, and predictive value for population screening. So, there is an urgent need to isolate novel sensitive, specific biomarkers to detect the disease early and improve prognosis, especially in high-mortality tumors. Proteomic techniques are powerful tools to help in diagnosis and monitoring of treatment and progression of the disease. During the last decade, mass spectrometry has assumed a key role in most of the proteomic analyses that are focused on identifying cancer biomarkers in human serum, making it possible to identify and characterize at the molecular level many proteins or peptides differentially expressed. In this paper we summarize the results of mass spectrometry serum profiling and biomarker identification in high mortality tumors, such as ovarian, liver, lung, and pancreatic cancer.},

  abstract = {The relationship between smoking and melanoma remains unclear. Among the different results is the paradoxical finding that smoking was shown to be inversely associated with the risk of malignant melanoma in some large cohort and case-control studies, even after control for suspected confounding variables. Smoking is a known risk factor for many non-communicable diseases, including coronary heart disease, stroke, as well as other malignancies; it has been shown to be positively associated with other types of skin cancer, and there remains no clear biologic explanation for a possible protective effect on malignant melanoma. In this paper, we propose a plausible mechanism of bias from smoking-related competing risks that may explain or contribute to the inverse association between smoking and melanoma as spurious. Using directed acyclic graphs for formalization and visualization of assumptions, and Monte Carlo simulation techniques, we demonstrate how published inverse associations might be compatible with selection bias resulting from uncontrolled or unmeasured common causes of competing outcomes of smoking-related diseases and malignant melanoma. We present results from various scenarios assuming a true null as well as a true positive association between smoking and malignant melanoma. Under a true null assumption, we find inverse associations due to the biasing mechanism to be compatible with published results in the literature, especially after the addition of unmeasured confounding variables. This study could be seen as offering a cautionary note in the interpretation of published smoking-melanoma findings.},

The authors analyzed prospective data from 43,457 overweight, never-smoking US white women aged 40\textendash 64 years who in 1959\textendash 1960 completed a questionnaire that included questions on weight change direction, amount, time interval, and intentionallty. Vital status was determined in 1972. Proportional hazards regression was used to estimate mortality rate ratios for women who intentionally lost weight compared with women who had no change in weight. Women who died within the first 3 years of follow-up were excluded. Analyses were stratified by preexisting illness and adjusted for age, beginning body mass index, alcohol intake, education, physical activity, and health conditions. In women with obesity-related health conditions (n = 15,069), intentional weight loss of any amount was associated with a 20\% reduction in all-cause mortality, primarily due to a 40\textendash 50\% reduction in mortality from obesity-related cancers; diabetes-associated mortality was also reduced by 30\textendash 40\% in those who intentionally lost weight. In women with no preexisting illness \{n = 28,388), intentional weight loss of {$\geq$}20 Ib ({$\geq$}9.1 kg) that occurred within the previous year was associated with about a 25\% reduction in all-cause, cardiovascular, and cancer mortality; however, loss of {$<$}20 Ib ({$<$}9.1 kg) or loss that occurred over an interval of {$\geq$}1 year was generally associated with small to modest increases in mortality. The association between intentional weight loss and longevity in middle-aged overweight women appears to depend on their health status. Intentional weight loss among women with obesity-related conditions is generally associated with decreased premature mortality, whereas among women with no preexisting illness, the association is equivocal.\vphantom\}},

  abstract = {Background: Trial investigators frequently exclude patients from trial analyses which may bias estimates of the effect of treatment. Combining these estimates in a meta-analysis could aggregate any such biases. Methods: To investigate how excluding patients from trials can affect the results of both trials and meta-analyses, we used 14 meta-analyses of individual patient data (IPD) that addressed therapeutic questions in cancer. These included 133 randomized controlled trials (RCT) and 21 905 patients. We explored whether exclusions were related to trial characteristics and categorized the reasons for exclusions. For each RCT and meta-analysis, we compared results of an intention-to-treat analysis of all randomized patients with an analysis based on those patients included in the investigators' analysis. Results: In all, 92 trials (69\%) excluded between 0.3 and 38\% of patients randomized. Trials excluding patients tended to be older and larger than those that did not. Most patients were excluded because of ineligibility or protocol violations. Exclusions varied substantially by meta-analysis, more patients tending to be excluded from the treatment arm. Comparing trial analyses there was no clear indication that exclusion of patients altered the results more in favour of either treatment or control. However, comparing meta-analysis results, there was a tendency for those based on 'included' patients to favour the research treatment (P = 0.03). Inconsistency of trial results was often increased as a result of the investigators' exclusions. Conclusions: Trials, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses may be prone to bias associated with post-randomization exclusion of patients. Wherever possible, the level of such exclusions should be taken into account when assessing the potential for bias in trials, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses. Ideally, trials, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses should be based on all randomized patients. \textcopyright{} International Epidemiological Association 2004; all rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Maternal injuries during pregnancy are common (a7\% prevalence). However, few studies have examined the association between maternal injuries and birth defects. The National Birth Defects Prevention Study is a population-based case-control study of birth defects in 10 US states. Cases were ascertained through surveillance; controls were randomly selected from infants delivered without major birth defects in the study regions. Mothers completed a telephone interview on exposures before and during pregnancy, including injuries. We assessed associations between periconceptional (month before until the end of the third month of pregnancy) maternal injuries and birth defects. We used logistic regression to estimate adjusted odds ratios (AORs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CI). Periconceptional injuries were associated with interrupted aortic arch type B [AOR = 5.2, 95\% CI 1.2, 23.2]; atrioventricular septal defect [AOR = 2.2, 95\% CI 1.1, 4.4]; pulmonary atresia [AOR = 3.2, 95\% CI 1.6, 6.4]; tricuspid atresia [AOR = 2.8, 95\% CI 1.2, 6.7]; hypoplastic left heart syndrome [AOR = 2.0, 95\% CI 1.1, 3.4]; anorectal atresia/stenosis [AOR = 1.7, 95\% CI 1.0, 2.7]; longitudinal limb deficiency [AOR = 2.1, 95\% CI 1.1, 3.9]; and gastroschisis [AOR = 1.8, 95\% CI 1.2, 2.8]. Associations with longitudinal limb deficiency, gastroschisis and hypoplastic left heart syndrome were stronger for intentional injuries. Our results suggest maternal injury during the periconceptional period, particularly those inflicted intentionally, may be associated with select birth defects. This analysis was hypothesis-generating, with many associations tested. Further research is warranted. \textcopyright{} 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

Dates of conception were estimated using last menstrual period and clinical estimates of gestation. Proportions of births conceived per month were assessed for seasonal patterns. Proportions of births with late initiation of prenatal care were also compared by month of conception. The outcomes were further stratified by sociodemographic variables.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nRESULTS: There was a consistent summer trough (7.5\% in August) and year-end peak (9.1\% in December) in conception of births to adolescents (P {$<$}.001), a pattern similar to that of older teenagers and adults. Among the adolescents, students and non-Hispanic women giving birth presented a secondary early summer peak (8.8\% each in May and June) in their conceptions. There was a modest bimodal effect of season of conception on initiation of prenatal care in all age groups. Adolescent conceptions in April-May and September-October were 14-18\% and 6\% significantly more likely to have late prenatal care compared with other months, respectively.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSION: Adolescents giving birth in Texas were not more likely to conceive in the summer.

Schools have started to make policy decisions based on a popularly presumed connection between nutrition and academic achievement. This study aimed to determine whether such a relationship exists, and if so, its nature.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nMETHODS: \hspace{1em} Data from the Food Consumption Questionnaire administered to approximately 12\hspace{1em}000 fifth graders as part of the nationally representative Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Cohort was analysed using regression analysis. The analysis used propensity score matching to examine the relationship between students' reported fast-food consumption and their test scores in reading and mathematics. Propensity score matching attempts to control for a host of background characteristics that might be correlated with both fast-food consumption and test scores.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nRESULTS: \hspace{1em} Standard ordinary least squares regression showed that test scores decreased as reported fast-food consumption increased. In the propensity-score-matched analysis, which controlled for 25 student background characteristics, higher-than-average fast-food consumption ('four to six times in the last 7 days' or more) was associated with significantly lower test scores in both reading (-11.15 points or 0.48\hspace{1em}SD) and math (-11.13 points or 0.52\hspace{1em}SD), even when teacher experience, school poverty level and school urbanicity were also included in the model.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSIONS: \hspace{1em} Although this study is preliminary, its results indicate that the relationship between poor nutrition and test scores may in fact be quite negative, strengthening the impetus for schools to consider policies that support students' healthy eating.

The scientific community has generally agreed on the health effects of climate extremes (eg, heatwaves, droughts, floods, storms and bushfires), but has been debating on many other important issues such as climate change and infectious diseases and interactive health impact of weather and air pollution. Many knowledge gaps remain in the assessment of the potential impact of climate change on population health. Scientists and policy-makers face the following five major tasks: 1) establishing baseline relationships between climate and health; 2) seeking evidence of early effects of climate change; 3) developing scenario-based predictive models; 4) evaluating adaptation options; and 5) assessing benefits and costs of mitigation and adaptation. All these tasks require i) a well coordinated multi-disciplinary approach; ii) high quality data on climate, health outcomes and confounding factors; iii) appropriate research methodology for undertaking each of these tasks; and iv) sufficient research funding. These issues will be illustrated with examples from our previous work.},

Various methodological reasons can help explain why these rates are lower than those found in previous wars. One primary reason is varying methods of diagnosis. Other reasons include differences in percentages of active-duty personnel, windows of observation, and methods of calculating rates. In addition, comorbidity for some mental disorders and specific risks for developing certain disorders complicate interpretation of rates. Nevertheless, Larson et al. document evidence for the "healthy warrior" effect - namely that deployed Marines have fewer mental disorders than nondeployed Navy and Marine Corps personnel, with the exception of stress disorders.

An example is chronic infection with hepatitis C virus, where the initial infection may be asymptomatic for decades. This problem leads to selection of more severely ill individuals into registers of such infections. Cohort studies often adjust for this bias by introducing a time window between entry into the cohort and entry into the study. This paper describes and assesses a novel method to improve adjustment for this type of selection bias. The size of the time window is decided by calculating a standardized incidence ratio as a continuous function of the size of the time window. The resulting graph is used to decide on an appropriate window size. The method is evaluated by using the Swedish register of hepatitis C virus infections for 1990-2006. The complications studied were non-Hodgkin lymphoma and liver cancer. Selection bias differed for the studied outcomes, and a time window of a minimum of 2 months and 12 months, respectively, was judged to be appropriate. The novel method may have advantages compared with an interval-based method, especially in cohort studies with small numbers of events.},

Selection bias in prevalent cohorts is often corrected by excluding observation time and events during the first time period after inclusion in the cohort. This time period must be chosen carefully-long enough to minimize selection bias but not too long so as to unnecessarily discard observation time and events. A novel method visualizing and estimating selection bias is described and exemplified by using 2 real cohort study examples: a study of hepatitis C virus infection and a study of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance. The method is based on modeling the hazard for the outcome of interest as a function of time since inclusion in the cohort. The events studied were "hospitalizations for kidney-related disease" in the hepatitis C virus cohort and "death" in the monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance cohort. Both cohorts show signs of considerable selection bias as evidenced by increased hazard in the time period after inclusion in the cohort. The method was very useful in visualizing selection bias and in determining the initial time period to be excluded from the analyses.},

  abstract = {Compared with natural conception, IVF is an effective form of fertility treatment associated with higher rates of obstetric complications and poorer neonatal outcomes. While some increased risk is intrinsic to the infertile population requiring treatment, the practice of multiple embryo transfer contributes to these complications and outcomes, especially concerning its role in higher order pregnancies. As a result, several jurisdictions (e.g. Sweden, Belgium, Turkey, and Quebec) have legally mandated elective single-embryo transfer (eSET) for young women. We accept that in very high-risk scenarios (e.g. past history of preterm delivery and poor maternal health), double-embryo transfer (DET) should be prohibited due to unacceptably high risks. However, we argue that mandating eSET for all young women can be considered an unacceptable breach of patient autonomy, especially since DET offers certain women financial and social advantages. We also show that mandated eSET is inconsistent with other practices (e.g. ovulation induction and intrauterine insemination\textendash ovulation induction) that can expose women and their offspring to risks associated with multiple pregnancies. While defending the option of DET for certain women, some recommendations are offered regarding IVF practice (e.g. preimplantation genetic screening and better support of IVF and maternity leave) to incentivise patients to choose eSET.},

  abstract = {Objective: To evaluate the clinical outcomes and development of children born after intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) with extracted testicular sperm or ejaculated extreme severe oligo-astheno-teratozoospermia (OAT) sperm. Design: Retrospective study. Setting: Infertility clinic at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital. Patient(s): A total of 126 ICSI cycles were performed using extracted testicular sperm from men with azoospermia and 65 ICSI cycles using fresh ejaculated sperm from men with extreme severe OAT. Intervention(s): Retrospective analysis of clinical outcomes and development of children born after ICSI with extracted testicular sperm or ejaculated extreme severe OAT sperm. Main Outcome Measure(s): Fertilization rates, number of grade 1 zygotes and number of embryos produced, implantation rate, clinical pregnancy rate, abortion and live birth rate per transfer, perinatal outcomes, and birth defects. Result(s): The demographic and clinical factors, including age, E 2 level on hCG day, number of oocytes retrieved, normal fertilization rate, zygote grade 1 score distribution, number of top-quality embryos transferred, clinical pregnancy rate per transfer, chemical pregnancy rate per transfer, implantation rate, live birth rate per transfer, and abortion rate per transfer, were similar between the groups. Sixty live births resulted from 48 extracted testicular sperm cycles and 21 live births from 19 extreme severe OAT. The obstetric and perinatal outcomes were similar between the groups, and children conceived by using ICSI were healthy and without major psychomotor or intellectual development retardation. One case of tetralogy of Fallot occurred in each group. Conclusion(s): There is no evidence of differences in the clinical outcomes and development of children result after ICSI with extracted testicular sperm or ejaculated extreme severe OAT sperm.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Parental feeding practices are thought to influence children's weight status, through children's eating behavior and nutritional intake. However, because most studies have been cross-sectional, the direction of influence is unclear. Moreover, although obesity rates are high among Latino children, few studies of parental feeding practices have focused on this population.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nMETHODS: This 2-year longitudinal study examined mutual influences over time between parental feeding practices and children's weight status, in Mexican American families with children 18~years old at baseline. Mothers (n\,=\,322) and fathers (n\,=\,182) reported on their feeding practices at baseline, 1-year follow-up, and 2-year follow-up. Weight status, defined by waist-height ratio (WHtR) and body mass index (BMI), was ascertained at all assessments. Cross-lagged panel models were used to examine the mutual influences of parental feeding practices and child weight status over time, controlling for covariates.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nRESULTS: Both mothers' and fathers' restriction of food predicted higher subsequent child weight status at Year 1, and for fathers this effect was also found at Year 2. Mothers' and fathers' pressure to eat predicted lower weight status among boys, but not girls, at Year 1. Child weight status also predicted some parental feeding practices: boys' heavier weight predicted mothers' less pressure to eat at Year 1, less use of food to control behavior at Year 2, and greater restriction at Year 2; and girls' heavier weight at Year 1 predicted fathers' less pressure to eat and less positive involvement in child eating at Year 2.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSIONS: This study provides longitudinal evidence that some parental feeding practices influence Mexican American children's weight status, and that children's weight status also influences some parental feeding practices. Feeding practices of both mothers and fathers were related to children's weight status, underscoring the importance of including fathers in research on parental feeding practices and child obesity.},

A total of 138 eligible women aged 20-45 were diagnosed laparoscopically and classified into three subgroups: control (no endometriosis), early endometriosis (stages I-II) and advanced endometriosis (stages III-IV). Neither CYP1A1 Ile462Val and CYP1B1 Leu432Val polymorphisms (genotypes with versus genotypes without the minor allele) nor serum dioxin and PCB toxic equivalency (TEQ) levels (low versus high) were independently associated with either early or advanced endometriosis risk. However, genotypes with the CYP1A1 462Val allele showed a statistically significant reduced risk of advanced endometriosis in combination with high serum dioxin TEQ levels (adjusted odds ratio = 0.13, 95\% confidence interval: 0.02-0.76) (P for interaction = 0.08). Although no association was found between serum PCB TEQ level and advanced endometriosis in any stratum of CYP1B1 Leu432Val polymorphism, a statistically significant interaction was found (P for interaction = 0.05). CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 polymorphisms may modify the relation between environmental exposure to organochlorine and advanced endometriosis risk.},

To address this problem, we present a computationally efficient and non-parametric interval estimator for a class of population parameters encompassing population means, ordinary least squares and instrumental variables estimands which makes minimal assumptions about the selection mechanism. Using results from stochastic programming, we derive valid confidence intervals and hypothesis tests for this estimator. In addition, we demonstrate how to tighten the intervals by incorporating constraints based on population-level information commonly available to researchers, such as survey response rates and covariate means. We also propose valid confidence intervals for our estimator over these stochastic constraints. We present a simulation illustrating the finite sample performance of our estimator and conclude by estimating the causal effect of education on income in the highly-selected UK Biobank cohort, demonstrating that our method can produce informative bounds under relatively few population-level information constraints.},

Here, we systematically review studies that have tested whether maternal pre-eclampsia, gestational hypertension, and hypertensive pregnancy disorders as a single diagnostic entity are associated with cognitive functioning of the offspring. Twenty-six studies were eligible for this review. Of them, 19 provided detailed methodological information deemed necessary to be included for a more detailed review. An overall conclusion is that, in the general population, maternal hypertensive disorders may be associated with lower cognitive ability of the offspring. Studies that extend to adulthood show the most consistent pattern of findings. It is possible that the associations arise during the lifetime or that the findings reflect improvements in management of these disorders. Evidence is, however, insufficient to conclude whether these associations are dissimilar in the offspring exposed to maternal pre-eclampsia and gestational hypertension, due to the varied criteria used across the different studies to distinguish between these conditions. The existing studies also vary in the definition of control groups, and very few have taken into account important confounding factors, including maternal pre-pregnancy obesity and lifestyle behaviors. Given the mixed pattern of findings and limitations related to internal and external validity, further studies are clearly warranted to clarify the associations.},

  abstract = {Objectives The purpose of the study was to investigate whether fertility therapy might contribute to subsequent cardiovascular disease. Background Fertility medications are used for 1\% of births yet may also lead to endothelial injury with long-term adverse consequences for the mother. Methods A population-based cohort analysis was performed of women who gave birth in Ontario, Canada, between July 1, 1993, and March 31, 2010, distinguishing those who did and did not receive fertility therapy in the 2 years before delivery. Cox proportional models were derived to estimate hazard ratios with and without adjustment for baseline characteristics. The primary outcome was a composite cardiovascular endpoint of death, nonfatal coronary ischemia, stroke, transient ischemic attack, thromboembolism, or heart failure. Results Among 1,186,753 women who delivered during the study period, 6,979 gave birth after fertility therapy. After 9.7 years of median follow-up, women who delivered after fertility therapy had fewer cardiovascular events than controls (103 vs. 117 events per 100,000 person-years), equivalent to an unadjusted hazard ratio of 0.96 (95\% confidence interval: 0.72 to 1.29, p = 0.79) and an adjusted hazard ratio of 0.55 (95\% confidence interval: 0.41 to 0.74, p {$<$} 0.0001). An apparent relative lower risk was observed across all age and income groups. Women who received fertility therapy also had lower risk-adjusted all-cause mortality, thromboembolic events, subsequent depression, alcoholism, and self-harm (p {$<$} 0.01 for each). Conclusions Successful fertility therapy was not associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease later in life. \textcopyright{} 2013 by the American College of Cardiology Foundation Published by Elsevier Inc.},

Acknowledging this idea, we propose a technique for measuring certain features of birthweight distributions useful to epidemiologists: the mean and variance of the predominant distribution; the proportions of births in the low- and high-birthweight residual distributions, and the boundaries of support for these  residual distributions. Our technique, based on an underlying multinomial sampling distribution, involves estimating parameters in a mixture model for the  multinomial bin probabilities after having chosen the support of the residual distribution with a model selection criterion. A modest simulation study and experience with a few actual datasets indicate that use of a Bayesian information criterion (BIC) as model selection criterion is superior to use of Akaike's information criterion (AIC) in this application.},

Persistent environmental chemicals that exhibit hormonal properties, such as organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), may affect endometriosis risk.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nOBJECTIVE: We investigated endometriosis risk in relation to environmental exposure to OCPs.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nMETHODS: We conducted the present analyses using data from the Women's Risk of Endometriosis (WREN) study, a population-based case-control study of endometriosis conducted among 18- to 49-year-old female enrollees of a large health care system in western Washington State. OCP concentrations were measured in sera from surgically confirmed endometriosis cases (n = 248) first diagnosed between 1996 and 2001 and from population-based controls (n = 538). We estimated odds ratios (OR) and 95\% CIs using unconditional logistic regression, adjusting for age, reference date year, serum lipids, education, race/ethnicity, smoking, and alcohol intake.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nRESULTS: Our data suggested increased endometriosis risk associated with serum concentrations of {$\beta$}-hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) (third vs. lowest quartile: OR = 1.7; 95\% CI: 1.0, 2.8; highest vs. lowest quartile OR = 1.3; 95\% CI: 0.8, 2.4) and mirex (highest vs. lowest category: OR = 1.5; 95\% CI: 1.0, 2.2).

In this paper, we investigate selection bias in multi-arm trials by its impact on the type I error probability. We propose two models for selection bias, so-called biasing policies, that both extend the classic guessing strategy by Blackwell and Hodges. We derive the distribution of the F-test statistic under the misspecified outcome model and provide a formula for the type I error probability under selection bias. We apply the presented approach to quantify the influence of selection bias in multi-arm trials with increasing number of treatment groups using a permuted block design for different assumptions and different biasing strategies. Our results confirm previous findings that smaller block sizes lead to a higher proportion of sequences with inflated type I error probability. Astonishingly, our results also show that the proportion of sequences with inflated type I error probability remains constant when the number of treatment groups is increased. Realizing that the impact of selection bias cannot be completely eliminated, we propose a bias adjusted statistical model and show that the power of the statistical test is only slightly deflated for larger block sizes.},

  abstract = {Mediation analysis is a popular approach to examine the extent to which the effect of an exposure on an outcome is through an intermediate variable (mediator) and the extent to which the effect is direct. When the mediator is mis-measured, the validity of mediation analysis can be severely undermined. In this paper, we first study the bias of classical, non-differential measurement error on a continuous mediator in the estimation of direct and indirect causal effects in generalized linear models when the outcome is either continuous or discrete and exposure-mediator interaction may be present. Our theoretical results as well as a numerical study demonstrate that in the presence of non-linearities, the bias of naive estimators for direct and indirect effects that ignore measurement error can take unintuitive directions. We then develop methods to correct for measurement error. Three correction approaches using method of moments, regression calibration, and SIMEX are compared. We apply the proposed method to the Massachusetts General Hospital lung cancer study to evaluate the effect of genetic variants mediated through smoking on lung cancer risk.},

  abstract = {An important goal across the biomedical and social sciences is the quantification of the role of intermediate factors in explaining how an exposure exerts an effect on an outcome. Selection bias has the potential to severely undermine the validity of inferences on direct and indirect causal effects in observational as well as in randomized studies. The phenomenon of selection may arise through several mechanisms, and we here focus on instances of missing data. We study the sign and magnitude of selection bias in the estimates of direct and indirect effects when data on any of the factors involved in the analysis is either missing at random or not missing at random. Under some simplifying assumptions, the bias formulae can lead to nonparametric sensitivity analyses. These sensitivity analyses can be applied to causal effects on the risk difference and risk-ratio scales irrespectively of the estimation approach employed. To incorporate parametric assumptions, we also develop a sensitivity analysis for selection bias in mediation analysis in the spirit of the expectation\textendash maximization algorithm. The approaches are applied to data from a health disparities study investigating the role of stage at diagnosis on racial disparities in colorectal cancer survival.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: To date, a counterfactual framework has not been used to study determinants of social inequalities in cancer. Considering the case of colorectal cancer, for which racial/ethnic differences in stage at diagnosis and survival are well documented, we quantify the extent to which black versus white survival disparities would be reduced had disparities in stage at diagnosis been eliminated in a large patient population. METHODS: We obtained data on colorectal cancer patients (diagnosed between 1992 and 2005 and followed until 2010) from US-SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results) cancer registries. We employed a counterfactual approach to estimate the mean survival time up to the 60th month since diagnosis for black colorectal cancer patients had black-white disparities in stage at diagnosis been eliminated. RESULTS: Black patients survive approximately 4.0 [confidence interval (CI), 4.6-3.2] months less than white patients within five years since diagnosis. Had disparities in stage at diagnosis been eliminated, survival disparities decrease to 2.6 (CI, 3.4-1.7) months, an approximately 35\% reduction. For patients diagnosed after the age of 65 years, disparities would be halved, while reduction of approximately 30\% is estimated for younger patients. Survival disparities would be reduced by approximately 44\% for women and approximately 26\% for men. CONCLUSIONS: Employing a counterfactual approach and allowing for heterogeneities in black-white disparities across patients' characteristics, we give robust evidence that elimination of disparities in stage at diagnosis contributes to a substantial reduction in survival disparities in colorectal cancer. IMPACT: We provide the first evidence in the SEER population that elimination of inequities in stage at diagnosis might lead to larger reductions in survival disparities among elderly and women.

The study of incident exposures is contrasted with studies of prevalent exposures in which follow-up may commence after first exposure. The former approach is seen as a hallmark of a good study and necessary for causal inference. We argue that studying incident exposures may be necessary in some situations, but it is not always necessary and is not the preferred option in many instances. Conducting a study involves decisions as to which person-time experience should be included. Although studies of prevalent exposures involve left truncation (missingness on the left), studies of incident exposures may involve right censoring (missingness on the right) and therefore may not be able to assess the long-term effects of exposure. These considerations have consequences for studies of dynamic (open) populations that involve a mixture of prevalent and incident exposures. We argue that studies with prevalent exposures will remain a necessity for epidemiology. The purpose of this paper is to restore the balance between the emphasis on first exposure cohorts and the richness of epidemiologic information obtained when studying prevalent exposures.},

  abstract = {Marginal structural models (MSM) are an important class of models in causal inference. Given a longitudinal data structure observed on a sample of n independent and identically distributed experimental units, MSM model the counterfactual outcome distribution corresponding with a static treatment intervention, conditional on user-supplied baseline covariates. Identification of a static treatment regimen-specific outcome distribution based on observational data requires, beyond the standard sequential randomization assumption, the assumption that each experimental unit has positive probability of following the static treatment regimen. The latter assumption is called the experimental treatment assignment (ETA) assumption, and is parameter-specific. In many studies the ETA is violated because some of the static treatment interventions to be compared cannot be followed by all experimental units, due either to baseline characteristics or to the occurrence of certain events over time. For example, the development of adverse effects or contraindications can force a subject to stop an assigned treatment regimen.In this article we propose causal effect models for a user-supplied set of realistic individualized treatment rules. Realistic individualized treatment rules are defined as treatment rules which always map into the set of possible treatment options. Thus, causal effect models for realistic treatment rules do not rely on the ETA assumption and are fully identifiable from the data. Further, these models can be chosen to generalize marginal structural models for static treatment interventions. The estimating function methodology of Robins and Rotnitzky (1992) (analogue to its application in Murphy, et. al. (2001) for a single treatment rule) provides us with the corresponding locally efficient double robust inverse probability of treatment weighted estimator.In addition, we define causal effect models for "intention-to-treat" regimens. The proposed intention-to-treat interventions enforce a static intervention until the time point at which the next treatment does not belong to the set of possible treatment options, at which point the intervention is stopped. We provide locally efficient estimators of such intention-to-treat causal effects.},

  abstract = {Regular case-control sampling is an extremely common design used to generate data to estimate effects of exposures or treatments on a binary outcome of interest when the proportion of cases (i.e., binary outcome equal to 1) in the population of interest is low. Case-control sampling represents a biased sample of a target population of interest by sampling a disproportional number of cases. Case-control studies are also commonly employed to estimate the effects of genetic markers or biomarkers on binary phenotypes. In this article we present a general method of estimation relying on knowing the prevalence probability, conditional on the matching variable if matching is used. Our general proposed methodology, involving a simple weighting scheme of cases and controls, maps any estimation method for a parameter developed for prospective sampling from the population of interest into an estimation method based on case-control sampling from this population. We show that this case-control weighting of an efficient estimator for a prospective sample from the target population of interest maps into an efficient estimator for matched and unmatched case-control sampling. In particular, we show how application of this generic methodology provides us with double robust locally efficient targeted maximum likelihood estimators of the causal relative risk and causal odds ratio for regular case control sampling and matched case control sampling. Various extensions and generalizations of our methods are discussed.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The aspiration of the granulosa cells that surround the oocyte and the use of gonadotropin releasing hormone agonists (GnRHa) during assisted reproduction technology (ART) treatment can interfere with the production, during the luteal phase, of progesterone, which is necessary for successful implantation of the embryo. Providing hormonal supplementation during the luteal phase with either progesterone itself, or human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), which stimulates progesterone production, may improve implantation and, thus, pregnancy rates.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nOBJECTIVES: To determine (1) if luteal phase support after assisted reproduction increases the pregnancy rate, (2) the optimal hormone for luteal phase support, i.e. hCG, progesterone, or a combination of both, and (3) the optimal route of progesterone administration.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nSEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders \& Subfertility Group trials register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (1971 to Dec 2003), EMBASE (1985 to Dec 2003). We handsearched reference lists of relevant articles were scanned, and abstract books from scientific meetings up to December 2003.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nSELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials of luteal phase support after ART treatment, comparing hCG or progesterone with placebo or no treatment, comparing progesterone with hCG, progesterone plus hCG, or progesterone plus estrogen, or comparing different routes of progesterone administration. Quasi-randomized trials were excluded from the main analyses, but included in a secondary analysis for each comparison.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: For each comparison, data on live birth, ongoing and clinical pregnancy per embryo or gamete transfer procedure, miscarriage per clinical pregnancy, ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) per transfer, and multiple pregnancy per clinical pregnancy were extracted into 2 x 2 tables and subgrouped by use of GnRHa in the ovarian stimulation regimen. The odds ratio (OR) and risk difference (RD) were calculated.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nMAIN RESULTS: Fifty-nine studies were included in the review. Luteal phase support with hCG provided significant benefit, compared to placebo or no treatment, in terms of increased ongoing pregnancy rates (odds ratio (OR) 2.38, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.32 to 4.29) and decreased miscarriage rates (OR 0.12, 95\% CI 0.03 to 0.50), but only when GnRHa was used. The odds of OHSS increased 20-fold when hCG was used in cycles with GnRHa. Progesterone use resulted in a small but significant increase in pregnancy rates (OR 1.34, 95\% CI 1.01 to 1.79) when trials with and without GnRHa were grouped together, but no effect on the miscarriage rate was observed. No significant difference was found between progesterone and hCG or between progesterone and progesterone plus hCG or estrogen in terms of pregnancy or miscarriage rates, but the odds of OHSS were more than 2-fold higher with treatments involving hCG than with progesterone alone(OR 3.06, 95\% CI 1.59 to 5.86). Comparing routes of progesterone administration, reductions in clinical pregnancy rate with the oral route, compared to the intramuscular or vaginal routes, did not reach statistical significance, but there was evidence of benefit of the intramuscular over the vaginal route for the outcomes of ongoing pregnancy and live birth. No significant difference in pregnancy rate was observed between vaginal progesterone gel and other types of vaginal progesterone.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Luteal phase support with hCG or progesterone after assisted reproduction results in an increased pregnancy rate. hCG does not provide better results than progesterone, and is associated with a greater risk of OHSS when used with GnRHa. The optimal route of progesterone administration has not yet been established.},

Directed acyclic graphs clarify the causal relationships necessary for a particular variable to serve as an effect modifier for the causal risk difference involving 2 other variables. The directed acyclic graph causal framework thereby gives rise to a 4-fold classification for effect modification: direct effect modification, indirect effect modification, effect modification by proxy and effect modification by a common cause. We briefly discuss the case of multiple effect modification relationships and multiple effect modifiers as well as measures of effect other than that of the causal risk difference.},

It is also possible to determine the sign of the conditional covariance of two causes when conditioning on their common effect if some knowledge of the sufficient-cause mechanisms for the common effect is available. The incorporation of sufficient causes within the DAG framework also allows for the representation of interactions on DAGs and for the unification of several different causal frameworks.

The refinement is also useful in showing that additional assumptions (referred to here as treatment-variation irrelevance assumptions), stronger than those given by Cole and Frangakis, are in fact necessary in articulating the ordinary assumptions of ignorability or exchangeability. The refinement furthermore sheds light on the distinction between intervention and choice in reasoning about causality. A distinction between the range of treatment variations for which potential outcomes can be defined and the range for which treatment comparisons are made is discussed in relation to issues of nonadherence. The use of stochastic counterfactuals can help relax what is effectively being presupposed by the treatment-variation irrelevance assumption and the consistency assumption.},

A simple technique to estimate direct and indirect effect odds ratios by combining logistic and linear regressions is described that applies when the outcome is rare and the mediator continuous. Further discussion is given as to how this mediation analysis technique can be extended to settings in which data come from a case-control study design. For the standard mediation analysis techniques used in the epidemiologic and social science literatures to be valid, an assumption of no interaction between the effects of the exposure and the mediator on the outcome is needed. The approach presented here, however, will apply even when there are interactions between the effect of the exposure and the mediator on the outcome.},

For example, one might be interested in the extent to which the effect of diet on blood pressure is mediated through sodium intake and the extent to which it operates through other pathways. In the context of such mediation analysis, even if the effect of the exposure on the outcome is unconfounded, estimates of direct and indirect effects will be biased if control is not made for confounders of the mediator-outcome relationship. Often data are not collected on such mediator-outcome confounding variables; the results in this paper allow researchers to assess the sensitivity of their estimates of direct and indirect effects to the biases from such confounding. Specifically, the paper provides formulas for the bias in estimates of direct and indirect effects due to confounding of the exposure-mediator relationship and of the mediator-outcome relationship. Under some simplifying assumptions, the formulas are particularly easy to use in sensitivity analysis. The bias formulas are illustrated by examples in the literature concerning direct and indirect effects in which mediator-outcome confounding may be present.},

In this paper, the authors show that subadditivity necessarily implies at least one of these 3 forms of antagonism. Empirical conditions for specific forms of antagonism are given for settings in which monotonicity assumptions are and are not considered plausible. The implications of subadditivity and superadditivity for causal co-action for either an outcome or its absence are characterized under various assumptions about monotonicity. A simple computational procedure is described for assessing whether any specific form of causal co-action can be detected for either an outcome or its absence for both cohort and case-control data.

Whereas prior results give bounds that contain the null hypothesis of no direct effect, the results presented here will in many instances yield bounds that do not contain the null hypothesis of no direct effect. For contexts in which a set of variables intercepts all paths between a treatment and an outcome, it is possible to provide a definition for a controlled mediated effect. We discuss the identification of these controlled mediated effects; the bounds for controlled direct effects are applicable also to controlled mediated effects.

This approach to estimating additive interaction has come under some criticism because of possible misspecification of the logistic model: If the underlying model is linear, the logistic model will be misspecified. The authors propose an inverse probability of treatment weighting approach to causal effects and additive interaction in case-control studies. Under the assumption of no unmeasured confounding, the approach amounts to fitting a marginal structural linear odds model. The approach allows for the estimation of measures of additive interaction between dichotomous exposures, such as the relative excess risk due to interaction, using case-control data without having to rely on modeling assumptions for the outcome conditional on the exposures and covariates. Rather than using conditional models for the outcome, models are instead specified for the exposures conditional on the covariates. The approach is illustrated by assessing additive interaction between genetic and environmental factors using data from a case-control study.},

  abstract = {It is common practice in perinatal epidemiology to calculate gestational-age-specific or birth-weight-specific associations between an exposure and a perinatal outcome. Gestational age or birth weight, for example, might lie on a pathway from the exposure to the outcome. This practice of conditioning on a potential intermediate has come under critique for various reasons. First, if one is interested in assessing the overall effect of an exposure on an outcome, it is not necessary to stratify, and indeed, it is important not to stratify, on an intermediate. Second, if one does condition on an intermediate, to try to obtain what might conceived of as a "direct effect" of the exposure on the outcome, then various biases and paradoxical results can arise. It is now well documented theoretically and empirically that, when there is an unmeasured common cause of the intermediate and the outcome, associations adjusted for the intermediate are subject to bias. In this paper, we propose 3 approaches to facilitate valid inference when effects conditional on an intermediate are in view. These 3 approaches correspond to (i) conditioning on the predicted risk of the intermediate, (ii) conditioning on the intermediate itself in conjunction with sensitivity analysis, and (iii) conditioning on the subgroup of individuals for whom the intermediate would occur irrespective of the exposure received. The second and third approaches both require sensitivity analysis, and they result in a range of estimates. Each of the 3 approaches can be used to resolve the "birth-weight paradox" that exposures such as maternal smoking seem to have a protective effect among low-birth-weight infants. The various methodologic approaches described in this paper are applicable to a number of similar settings in perinatal epidemiology. \textcopyright{} 2011 by Lippincott Williams \& Wilkins.},

Measurement errors in the exposure and the outcome are said to be independent of each other if the measured exposure and the measured outcome are statistically independent conditional on the true exposure and true outcome (and dependent otherwise). Measurement error is said to be nondifferential if measurement of the exposure does not depend on the true outcome conditional on the true exposure and vice versa; otherwise it is said to be differential. Few results on differential and dependent measurement error are available in the literature. Here the authors use formal rules governing associations on signed directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to draw conclusions about the presence and sign of causal effects under differential and dependent measurement error. The authors apply these rules to 4 forms of measurement error: independent nondifferential, dependent nondifferential, independent differential, and dependent differential. For a binary exposure and outcome, the authors generalize Weinberg et al.'s (Am J Epidemiol. 1994;140(6):565-571) result for nondifferential measurement error on preserving the direction of a trend to settings which also allow measurement error in the outcome and to cases involving dependent and/or differential error. \textcopyright{} The Author 2012.

  abstract = {The causal inference literature has provided definitions of direct and indirect effects based on counterfactuals that generalize the approach found in the social science literature. However, these definitions presuppose well-defined hypothetical interventions on the mediator. In many settings, there may be multiple ways to fix the mediator to a particular value, and these various hypothetical interventions may have very different implications for the outcome of interest. In this paper, we consider mediation analysis when multiple versions of the mediator are present. Specifically, we consider the problem of attempting to decompose a total effect of an exposure on an outcome into the portion through the intermediate and the portion through other pathways. We consider the setting in which there are multiple versions of the mediator but the investigator has access only to data on the particular measurement, not information on which version of the mediator may have brought that value about. We show that the quantity that is estimated as a natural indirect effect using only the available data does indeed have an interpretation as a particular type of mediated effect; however, the quantity estimated as a natural direct effect, in fact, captures both a true direct effect and an effect of the exposure on the outcome mediated through the effect of the version of the mediator that is not captured by the mediator measurement. The results are illustrated using 2 examples from the literature, one in which the versions of the mediator are unknown and another in which the mediator itself has been dichotomized.},

Both concepts are also properties of the population, and both are relative to the specific exposure and to the specific outcome.

Here, it is shown that what is often taken as an indirect effect can in fact be further decomposed into a "pure" indirect effect and a mediated interactive effect, thus yielding a three-way decomposition of a total effect (direct, indirect, and interactive). This three-way decomposition applies to difference scales and also to additive ratio scales and additive hazard scales. Assumptions needed for the identification of each of these three effects are discussed and simple formulae are given for each when regression models allowing for interaction are used. The three-way decomposition is illustrated by examples from genetic and perinatal epidemiology, and discussion is given to what is gained over the traditional two-way decomposition into a direct and an indirect effect.},

  abstract = {Surrogates which allow one to predict the effect of the treatment on the outcome of interest from the effect of the treatment on the surrogate are of importance when it is difficult or expensive to measure the primary outcome. Unfortunately, the use of such surrogates can give rise to paradoxical situations in which the effect of the treatment on the surrogate is positive, the surrogate and outcome are strongly positively correlated, but the effect of the treatment on the outcome is negative, a phenomenon sometimes referred to as the "surrogate paradox." New results are given for consistent surrogates that extend the existing literature on sufficient conditions that ensure the surrogate paradox is not manifest. Specifically, it is shown that for the surrogate paradox to be manifest it must be the case that either there is (i) a direct effect of treatment on the outcome not through the surrogate and in the opposite direction as that through the surrogate or (ii) confounding for the effect of the surrogate on the outcome, or (iii) a lack of transitivity so that treatment does not positively affect the surrogate for all the same individuals for whom the surrogate positively affects the outcome. The conditions for consistent surrogates and the results of the article are important because they allow investigators to predict the direction of the effect of the treatment on the outcome simply from the direction of the effect of the treatment on the surrogate. These results on consistent surrogates are then related to the four approaches to surrogate outcomes described by Joffe and Greene (2009, Biometrics 65, 530-538) to assess whether the standard criteria used by these approaches to assess whether a surrogate is "good" suffice to avoid the surrogate paradox.},

When adjustment is also made for adult socioeconomic status, we note how the overall racial inequality can be decomposed into the portion that would be eliminated by equalizing adult socioeconomic status across racial groups and the portion of the inequality that would remain even if adult socioeconomic status across racial groups were equalized. We also discuss a stronger interpretation of the effect of race (stronger in terms of assumptions) involving the joint effects of race-associated physical phenotype (eg, skin color), parental physical phenotype, genetic background, and cultural context when such variables are thought to be hypothetically manipulable and if adequate control for confounding were possible. We discuss some of the challenges with such an interpretation. Further discussion is given as to how the use of selected populations in examining racial disparities can additionally complicate the interpretation of the effects.},

We give non-parametric identification results, discuss parametric im- plementation, and also provide a weighting approach to direct and indirect effects based on combining the results of two marginal structural models. We also discuss how our results give rise to a causal interpretation of the effect estimates produced from longitudinal structural equation models. When there are no time-varying confounders affected by prior exposure and mediator values, identification of di- rect and indirect effects is achieved by a longitudinal version of Pearl's mediation formula. When there are time-varying confounders affected by prior exposure and mediator, natural direct and indirect effects are not identified. We define a randomized interventional analogue of natural direct and indirect effects that are identified in this setting. The formula that identifies these effects we refer to as the ``mediational g-formula.'' When there is no mediation, the mediational g-formula reduces to Robins' regular g-formula for longitudinal data. When there are no time-varying confouders affected by prior exposure and mediator values, then the mediational g-formula reduces to a longitudinal version of Pearl's mediation for- mula. However, the mediational g-formula itself can accomodate both mediation and time-varying confounders.},

This article introduces a new measure called the ``E-value,'' which is related to the evidence for causality in observational studies that are potentially subject to confounding. The E-value is de- fined as the minimum strength of association, on the risk ratio scale, that an unmeasured confounder would need to have with both the treatment and the outcome to fully explain away a spe- cific treatment\textendash outcome association, conditional on the mea- sured covariates. A large E-value implies that considerable un- measured confounding would be needed to explain away an effect estimate. A small E-value implies little unmeasured con- founding would be needed to explain away an effect estimate. The authors propose that in all observational studies intended to produce evidence for causality, the E-value be reported or some other sensitivity analysis be used. They suggest calculating the E-value for both the observed association estimate (after adjust- ments for measured confounders) and the limit of the confi- dence interval closest to the null. If this were to become standard practice, the ability of the scientific community to assess evi- dence from observational studies would improve considerably, and ultimately, science would be strengthened.},

  abstract = {A common reason given for assessing interaction is to evaluate "whether the effect is larger in one group versus another". It has long been known that the answer to this question is scale dependent: the "effect" may be larger for one subgroup on the difference scale, but smaller on the ratio scale. In this article, we show that if the relative magnitude of effects across subgroups is of interest then there exists an "interaction continuum" that characterizes the nature of these relations. When both main effects are positive then the placement on the continuum depends on the relative magnitude of the probability of the outcome in the doubly exposed group. For high probabilities of the outcome in the doubly exposed group, the interaction may be positive-multiplicative positive-additive, the strongest form of positive interaction on the "interaction continuum". As the probability of the outcome in the doubly exposed group goes down, the form of interaction descends through ranks, of what we will refer to as the following: positive-multiplicative positive-additive, no-multiplicative positive-additive, negative-multiplicative positive-additive, negative-multiplicative zero-additive, negative-multiplicative negative-additive, single pure interaction, single qualitative interaction, single-qualitative single-pure interaction, double qualitative interaction, perfect antagonism, inverted interaction. One can thus place a particular set of outcome probabilities into one of these eleven states on the interaction continuum. Analogous results are also given when both exposures are protective, or when one is protective and one causative. The "interaction continuum" can allow for inquiries as to relative effects sizes, while also acknowledging the scale dependence of the notion of interaction itself.},

We have elsewhere proposed that the reporting of E-values for estimates and for the limit of the confidence interval closest to the null become routine whenever causal effects are of interest. A number of questions have arisen about the use of E-value including questions concerning the interpretation of the relevant confounding association parameters, the nature of the transformation from the risk ratio scale to the E-value scale, inference for and using E-values, and the relation to Rosenbaum's notion of design sensitivity. Here we bring these various questions together and provide responses that we hope will assist in the interpretation of E-values and will further encourage their use.},

In the case of differential measurement error of the outcome, it is shown that the true effect of the exposure on the outcome on the risk ratio scale must be at least as large as the observed association between the exposure and the mismeasured outcome divided by the maximum strength of differential measurement error. This maximum strength of differential measurement error is itself assessed as the risk ratio of the controlled direct effect of the exposure on the mismeasured outcome not through the true outcome. In the case of differential measurement error of the exposure, under certain assumptions concerning classification probabilities, the true effect on the odds ratio scale of the exposure on the outcome must be at least as large as the observed odds ratio between the mismeasured exposure and the outcome divided by the maximum odds ratio of the effect of the outcome on mismeasured exposure conditional on the true exposure. The results can be immediately used to indicate the minimum strength of differential measurement error that would be needed to explain away an observed association between an exposure measurement and an outcome measurement for this to be solely due to measurement error.},

In this paper we derive optimal analytic conversions of odds ratios and hazard ratios to risk ratios that are minimax for the bias ratio when outcome probabilities are specified to fall in any fixed interval. The results for hazard ratios are derived under a proportional hazard assumption for the exposure. For outcome probabilities specified to lie in symmetric intervals centered around 0.5, it is shown that the square-root transformation of the odds ratio is the optimal minimax conversion for the risk ratio. General results for any non-symmetric interval are given both for odds ratio and for hazard ratio conversions. The results are principally useful when odds ratios or hazard ratios are reported in papers and the reader does not have access to the data or to information about the overall outcome prevalence.

The use of Web-based questionnaires may be an attractive alternative but is still scarce in epidemiologic research because of major concerns about selective nonresponse and reliability of the data obtained. The authors discuss advantages and disadvantages of Web-based questionnaires and current developments in this area. In addition, they focus on some practical issues and safety concerns involved in the application of Web-based questionnaires in epidemiologic research. They conclude that many problems related to the use of Web-based questionnaires have been solved or will most likely be solved in the near future and that this mode of data collection offers serious benefits. However, questionnaire design issues may have a major impact on response and completion rates and on reliability of the data. Theoretically, Web-based questionnaires could be considered an alternative or complementary mode in the range of epidemiologic methods of data collection. Practice and comparisons with the traditional survey techniques should reveal whether they can fulfill their expectations. \textcopyright{} 2010 The Author.},

Here, we systematically review studies that have explored associations between maternal overweight and obesity in pregnancy and cognitive, behavioural and emotional problems in offspring. The  12 studies eligible for this review examined a wide range of outcomes across the  lifespan and eight provided evidence of a link. These data suggest that the offspring of obese pregnancies may be at increased risk of cognitive problems and symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in childhood, eating disorders in adolescence and psychotic disorders in adulthood. Given the limitations of existing data, these findings warrant further study, particularly  in light of the current worldwide obesity epidemic.},

Traditional approaches build on standard regression models for the outcome and mediator, but easily result in difficult-to-interpret or difficult-to-report results when some of these models involve non-linearities. In this article, we overcome this via a general class of so-called natural effect models, which directly parameterize the (natural) direct and indirect effects of interest. We propose flexible estimation strategies for the direct and indirect effect parameters indexing these models, that are easy to perform with standard statistical software: one based on regression mean imputation and one based on doubly robust imputation. We give a theoretical discussion of the properties of these estimation strategies. We moreover assess their finite-sample performance through a simulation study, and through the analysis of the WHO-LARES study on the association between residence in a damp and moldy dwelling and the risk of depression.},

The default assumptions on which it relies are strong, however. In particular, they are known to be violated when confounders of the mediator-outcome association are affected by the exposure. This complicates extensions of counterfactual-based mediation analysis to settings that involve repeatedly measured mediators, or multiple correlated mediators. VanderWeele, Vansteelandt, and Robins introduced so-called interventional (in)direct effects. These can be identified under much weaker conditions than natural (in)direct effects, but have the drawback of not adding up to the total effect. In this article, we adapt their proposal to achieve an exact decomposition of the total effect, and extend it to the multiple mediator setting. Interestingly, the proposed effects capture the path-specific effects of an exposure on an outcome that are mediated by distinct mediators, even when-as often-the structural dependence between the multiple mediators is unknown, for instance, when the direction of the causal effects between the mediators is unknown, or there may be unmeasured common causes of the mediators.},

This makes the instrumental variables analysis of such studies sensitive to survivor bias, a type of selection bias. A particular concern is that the instrumental variable conditions, even when valid for the source population, may be violated for the selective population of individuals who survive the onset of the study. This is potentially very damaging because Mendelian randomization studies are known to be sensitive to bias due to even minor violations of the instrumental variable conditions. Interestingly, the instrumental variable conditions continue to hold within certain risk sets of individuals who are still alive at a given age when the instrument and unmeasured confounders exert additive effects on the exposure, and moreover, the exposure and unmeasured confounders exert additive effects on the hazard of death. In this article, we will exploit this property to derive a two-stage instrumental variable estimator for the effect of exposure on mortality, which is insulated against the above described selection bias under these additivity assumptions.},

Main Outcome Measure(s) The outcome of 1 or {$\geq$}2 live births after a single retrieval cycle, followed by use of all embryos in subsequent frozen cycles in relation to oocyte number. Result(s) The pregnancy rate was statistically significantly higher when {$\geq$}15 oocytes were retrieved (289 of 699, 41.3\%) than {$<$}15 oocytes (518 of 1,419, 36.5\%). When investigating the outcome of {$\geq$}2 live births and assuming that all remaining frozen embryos were used, we found that 498 of 2,226 (22.4\%) patients would achieve {$\geq$}2 live births. We performed multivariate analysis, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the model was 0.802. When controlling for multiple factors we found that as the number of oocytes retrieved increased, the chance of at least two live births increased, with odds ratio 1.08 (8\% live birth increase per additional oocyte). Conclusion(s) We demonstrate that one fresh cycle with high oocyte yield is an optimal way to plan IVF treatment. With modern cryopreservation methods, the concept of ``one-and-done'' could safely achieve {$\geq$}2 live births with just one stimulation cycle in almost a quarter of our patients.},

The outcome was any measure of cognitive function in children aged {$<$}18 years. We considered observational studies and trials with allocation groups that differed by single nutrients. We searched Medline/PubMed and the Cochrane Library databases and reference lists of retrieved literature. Two reviewers independently extracted data from relevant articles. We used methods recommended by the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, University of York and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. Of 16,143 articles identified, 38 met inclusion criteria. Most studies were observational, and from high-income settings. There were few randomized controlled trials. There was consistent evidence linking maternal obesity with lower cognitive function in children; low maternal BMI has been inadequately studied. Among three studies of maternal vitamin D status, two showed lower cognitive function in children of deficient mothers. One trial of folic acid supplementation showed no effects on the children's cognitive function and evidence from 13 observational studies was mixed. Among seven studies of maternal vitamin B12 status, most showed no association, though two studies in highly deficient populations suggested a possible effect. Four out of six observational studies and two trials (including one in an Iron deficient population) found no association of maternal iron status with offspring cognitive function. One trial of maternal carbohydrate/protein supplementation showed no effects on offspring cognitive function. Current evidence that maternal nutritional status during pregnancy as defined by BMI, single micronutrient studies, or macronutrient intakes influences offspring cognitive function is inconclusive. There is a need for more trials especially in populations with high rates of maternal undernutrition. Registered in PROSPERO \textbackslash n CRD42013005702\textbackslash n \textbackslash n .},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate weight perception, dieting and emotional well being across the range of body mass index (BMI) in a population-based multiethnic sample of early adolescents. DESIGN: Cross-sectional population-based survey. SUBJECTS: In total, 2789 adolescents 11-14 years of age from three highly deprived regional authorities in East London, in 2001. MEASUREMENTS: Data were collected by student-completed questionnaire on weight perception, dieting history, mental and physical health, health behaviours, social capital and sociodemographic factors. Height and weight were measured by trained researchers. Overweight was defined as BMI {$>$} or =85th centile and obesity as BMI {$>$} or =98th centile. Underweight was defined as BMI{$<$} or =15th centile. RESULTS: In all, 73\% were from ethnic groups other than white British. Valid BMI were available for 2522 subjects (90.4\%) of whom 14\% were obese. Only 20\% of overweight boys and 51\% of overweight girls assessed their weight accurately. Accuracy of weight perception did not vary between ethnic groups. In all, 42\% of girls and 26\% of boys reported current dieting to lose weight. Compared with white British teenagers, a history of dieting was more common among Bangladeshi, Indian and mixed ethnicity boys and less likely among Pakistani girls. Self-esteem was not associated with BMI in girls but was significantly lower in obese boys than those of normal weight (P=0.02). Within ethnic subgroups, self-esteem was significantly lower in overweight white British boys (P=0.03) and obese Bangladeshi boys (P=0.01) and Bangladeshi girls (P=0.04), but significantly higher in obese black African girls (P=0.01) than those of normal weight. Obese young people had a higher prevalence of psychological distress (P=0.04), except among Bangladeshi teenagers, where overweight and obese young people had less psychological distress than those of normal weight (P=0.02). Birth outside the UK was associated with reduced risk of obesity in girls (P=0.02) but not with history of dieting, weight perception or psychological factors in either gender. CONCLUSION: High levels of current dieting for weight control and inaccurate perception of body mass are common across all ethnic groups. However, dieting history and the associations of obesity with self-esteem and psychological distress vary between ethnic groups. Interventions to prevent or treat obesity in black or minority ethnicity groups must consider cultural differences in the relationship between body mass, self-esteem and psychological distress.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: At present, the only way to conclusively diagnose endometriosis is laparoscopic inspection, preferably with histological confirmation. This contributes to the delay in the diagnosis of endometriosis which is 6-11 years. So far non-invasive diagnostic approaches such as ultrasound (US), MRI or blood tests do not have sufficient diagnostic power. Our aim was to develop and validate a non-invasive diagnostic test with a high sensitivity (80\% or more) for symptomatic endometriosis patients, without US evidence of endometriosis, since this is the group most in need of a non-invasive test.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nMETHODS: A total of 28 inflammatory and non-inflammatory plasma biomarkers were measured in 353 EDTA plasma samples collected at surgery from 121 controls without endometriosis at laparoscopy and from 232 women with endometriosis (minimal-mild n = 148; moderate-severe n = 84), including 175 women without preoperative US evidence of endometriosis. Surgery was done during menstrual (n = 83), follicular (n = 135) and luteal (n = 135) phases of the menstrual cycle. For analysis, the data were randomly divided into an independent training (n = 235) and a test (n = 118) data set. Statistical analysis was done using univariate and multivariate (logistic regression and least squares support vector machines (LS-SVM) approaches in training- and test data set separately to validate our findings.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nRESULTS: In the training set, two models of four biomarkers (Model 1: annexin V, VEGF, CA-125 and glycodelin; Model 2: annexin V, VEGF, CA-125 and sICAM-1) analysed in plasma, obtained during the menstrual phase, could predict US-negative endometriosis with a high sensitivity (81-90\%) and an acceptable specificity (68-81\%). The same two models predicted US-negative endometriosis in the independent validation test set with a high sensitivity (82\%) and an acceptable specificity (63-75\%).\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSIONS: In plasma samples obtained during menstruation, multivariate analysis of four biomarkers (annexin V, VEGF, CA-125 and sICAM-1/or glycodelin) enabled the diagnosis of endometriosis undetectable by US with a sensitivity of 81-90\% and a specificity of 63-81\% in independent training- and test data set. The next step is to apply these models for preoperative prediction of endometriosis in an independent set of patients with infertility and/or pain without US evidence of endometriosis, scheduled for laparoscopy.},

Prentice (Biometrika 1986;73:1-11) showed how the case-cohort design can be used to obtain relative risk estimates for comparisons within the cohort being studied. In this paper, the authors consider ways in which the case-cohort design can be used for comparing risk in exposure groups within the cohort to the risk in an external population. The problem reduces to estimating the number of expected cases at each exposure level in the total cohort, when exposure status is available only for members of a subcohort, i.e., a random sample of the total cohort. The authors describe theoretical and empirical properties of several variations of the design and analysis of case-cohort studies. Empirical properties were examined by replicating the selection of the subcohort in a study of second cancer risk after chemotherapy for a first cancer. Use of a case-cohort design in that study would have saved five-sixths of the cost of gathering covariate information at the price of only an 11\% loss in efficiency relative to a full cohort study.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To assist in elucidating principles underlying the design of injury case-control studies.APPROACH: We begin by defining "event" as the sequence of circumstances that place a person at risk of injury (e.g. bicycle crash) and "injury given the event" as the resultant physical damage (e.g. head injury in bicycle crash). We then identify two broad classes of research question: 1) Studies of risk factors for the event, and, 2) Studies of risk factors for injury given the event. The study base for the first type of research question is all persons at risk of the event, while the study base for the second type is all persons who experience the event, and are therefore at risk of injury. It follows that in studies of risk factors for injury given the event, the controls should be a sample of all persons who experience the event. For example, in a study of bicycle helmets and head injuries, a suitable case group would be cyclists treated for head injury following a bicycle crash. The appropriate control group is drawn from the base population of all cyclists who crashed, including those who had no injuries. The control group may be restricted to cyclists who crashed and sought treatment for non-head injury under the assumption that the exposure distribution (prevalence of cycle helmet use) in the crash/no injury group is identical to the exposure distribution in the crash/non-head injury group.CONCLUSIONS: It is over ten years since innovative researchers in Seattle first applied the case-control design to the problem of bicycle crashes. Since then, successive bicycle injury studies at other centers have largely failed to extend and refine the Seattle methodology. A more critical approach to the design of case-control studies is required if we are to continue to advance the field of injury epidemiology.},

Study Design and Setting We review existing risk of bias tools. Drawing on these tools, we present domains of bias and suggest directions for evaluation questions. Results The review suggests that existing risk of bias tools provide, to different degrees, incomplete transparent criteria to assess the validity of these designs. The paper then presents an approach to evaluating the internal validity of quasi-experiments with selection on unobservables. Conclusion We conclude that tools for nonrandomized studies of interventions need to be further developed to incorporate evaluation questions for quasi-experiments with selection on unobservables.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE:: To examine whether sufficient research has been done and definite conclusions can be drawn on the psychological outcome of children born after in vitro fertilization (IVF), a review was performed of studies on early development, cognition, and psychosocial well-being in IVF children. METHOD:: PubMed and PsycINFO databases were searched. All English language studies up to 2006 addressing these topics were included. RESULTS:: After 25 years of follow-up studies on the development, school outcome, and psychosocial well-being of IVF children, it seems that mental and psychomotor development during the first year and preschool years and cognitive development at 5 years are not deviant. At 6-12 years of age, no differences were observed in cognitive and school performance compared with naturally conceived children; however, the number of studies in this age group is limited. No studies are available that evaluate cognitive aspects and school performance at secondary school age. Overall, positive parent-child relationships were reported in IVF families. In some studies, IVF mothers report more difficulties with their child's behavior only in the child's first year. With regard to the children's psychosocial well-being, no differences were found up to the age of 8 years. Although after that age, slight indications for some socioemotional and behavioral problems emerged, a large study on the onset of puberty reported that psychosocial functioning was reassuring.

  abstract = {We present new statistical analyses of data arising from a clinical trial designed to compare two-stage dynamic treatment regimes (DTRs) for advanced prostate cancer. The trial protocol mandated that patients were to be initially randomized among four chemotherapies, and that those who responded poorly were to be rerandomized to one of the remaining candidate therapies. The primary aim was to compare the DTRs' overall success rates, with success defined by the occurrence of successful responses in each of two consecutive courses of the patient's therapy. Of the one hundred and fifty study participants, forty seven did not complete their therapy per the algorithm. However, thirty five of them did so for reasons that precluded further chemotherapy; i.e. toxicity and/or progressive disease. Consequently, rather than comparing the overall success rates of the DTRs in the unrealistic event that these patients had remained on their assigned chemotherapies, we conducted an analysis that compared viable switch rules defined by the per-protocol rules but with the additional provision that patients who developed toxicity or progressive disease switch to a non-prespecified therapeutic or palliative strategy. This modification involved consideration of bivariate per-course outcomes encoding both efficacy and toxicity. We used numerical scores elicited from the trial's Principal Investigator to quantify the clinical desirability of each bivariate per-course outcome, and defined one endpoint as their average over all courses of treatment. Two other simpler sets of scores as well as log survival time also were used as endpoints. Estimation of each DTR-specific mean score was conducted using inverse probability weighted methods that assumed that missingness in the twelve remaining drop-outs was informative but explainable in that it only depended on past recorded data. We conducted additional worst-best case analyses to evaluate sensitivity of our findings to extreme departures from the explainable drop-out assumption.},

Despite the various estimation methods and statistical routines being developed, a unified approach for effect estimation under different effect decomposition scenarios is still needed for epidemiologic research. G-computation offers such unification and has been used for total effect and joint controlled direct effect estimation settings, involving different types of exposure and outcome variables. In this study, we demonstrate the utility of parametric g-computation in estimating various components of the total effect, including (1) natural direct and indirect effects, (2) standard and stochastic controlled direct effects, and (3) reference and mediated interaction effects, using Monte Carlo simulations in standard statistical software. For each study subject, we estimated their nested potential outcomes corresponding to the (mediated) effects of an intervention on the exposure wherein the mediator was allowed to attain the value it would have under a possible counterfactual exposure intervention, under a pre-specified distribution of the mediator independent of any causes, or under a fixed controlled value. A final regression of the potential outcome on the exposure intervention variable was used to compute point estimates and bootstrap was used to obtain confidence intervals. Through contrasting different potential outcomes, this analytical framework provides an intuitive way of estimating effects under the recently introduced 3- and 4-way effect decomposition. This framework can be extended to complex multivariable and longitudinal mediation settings.},

The discrete instrumental variable model has testable implications on the law of the observed data. However, current assessments of instrumental validity are typically based solely on subject-matter arguments rather than these testable implications, partly due to a lack of formal statistical tests with known properties. In this paper, we develop simple procedures for testing the binary instrumental variable model. Our methods are based on existing approaches for comparing two treatments, such as the t-test and the Gail--Simon test. We illustrate the importance of testing the instrumental variable model by evaluating the exogeneity of college proximity using the National Longitudinal Survey of Young Men.},

Using data from the Seveso Women's Health Study (SWHS), we examined the association between individual serum TCDD levels and breast cancer risk in women residing around Seveso, Italy, in 1976, at the time of an industrial explosion that resulted in the highest known population exposure to TCDD. The SWHS cohort comprises 981 women who were infants to 40 years old in 1976, resided in the most contaminated areas at the time of the explosion, and had archived sera that was collected soon after the explosion. For each woman, serum TCDD exposure was measured by high-resolution mass spectrometry. Cancer cases were identified during interview and confirmed by medical record. At interview, 15 women (1.5\%) had been diagnosed with breast cancer and serum TCDD levels for cases ranged from 13 to 1,960 ppt. Cox proportional hazards modeling showed that the hazard ratio for breast cancer associated with a 10-fold increase in serum TCDD levels (log(subscript)10(/subscript) TCDD) was significantly increased to 2.1 (95\% confidence interval, 1.0-4.6). Covariate-adjusted results were not different. Individual serum TCDD is significantly related with breast cancer incidence among women in the SWHS cohort. Continued follow-up of the cohort will help shed light on the possible role of TCDD in the pathogenesis of breast cancer.},

The International Agency for Research on Cancer classified TCDD as a known human carcinogen, based on predominantly male occupational studies of increased mortality from all cancers combined.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nOBJECTIVES: After a chemical explosion on 10 July 1976 in Seveso, Italy, residents experienced some of the highest levels of TCDD exposure in a human population. In 1996, we initiated the Seveso Women's Health Study (SWHS), a retrospective cohort study of the reproductive health of the women. We previously reported a significant increased risk for breast cancer and a nonsignificant increased risk for all cancers combined with individual serum TCDD, but the cohort averaged only 40 years of age in 1996. Herein we report results for risk of cancer from a subsequent follow-up of the cohort in 2008.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nMETHODS: In 1996, we enrolled 981 women who were 0-40 years of age in 1976, lived in the most contaminated areas, and had archived sera collected near the explosion. Individual TCDD concentration was measured in archived serum by high-resolution mass spectrometry. A total of 833 women participated in the 2008 follow-up study. We examined the relation of serum TCDD with cancer incidence using Cox proportional hazards models.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nRESULTS: In total, 66 (6.7\%) women had been diagnosed with cancer. The adjusted hazard ratio (HR) associated with a 10-fold increase in serum TCDD for all cancers combined was significantly increased [adjusted HR = 1.80; 95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.29, 2.52]. For breast cancer, the HR was increased, but not significantly (adjusted HR = 1.44; 95\% CI: 0.89, 2.33).\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSIONS: Individual serum TCDD is significantly positively related with all cancer incidence in the SWHS cohort, more than 30 years later. This all-female study adds to the epidemiologic evidence that TCDD is a multisite carcinogen.},

AHR function may be regulated by structural variations in AHR itself, in the AHR repressor (AHRR), in the AHR nuclear translocator (ARNT), or in AHR target molecules such as cytochrome P-4501A1 (CYP1A1) and glutathione S-transferase. Analysis of the genomic organization of AHRR revealed an open reading frame consisting of a 2094-bp mRNA encoded by ten exons. We found one novel polymorphism, a substitution of Ala by Pro at codon 185 (GCC to CCC), in exon 5 of the AHRR gene; among 108 healthy unrelated Japanese women, genotypes Ala/Ala, Ala/Pro, and Pro/Pro were represented, respectively, by 20 (18.5\%), 49 (45.4\%), and 39 (36.1\%) individuals. We did not detect previously published polymorphisms of ARNT (D511N) or the CYP1A1 promoter (G-469A and C-459T) in our subjects, suggesting that these polymorphisms are rare in the Japanese population.

By contrast, although the difference in the allele frequency of the AHRR polymorphism did not reach a significant level, the genotype frequency was statistically significantly different between the two groups of men. Furthermore, the statistical difference became more significant when the frequency was compared between the Pro/Pro genotype and the Pro/Ala plus Ala/Ala genotype.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSION(S): The Pro185Ala polymorphism in AHRR may constitute a susceptibility locus for dioxin-related male infertility. It appears that the negative feedback effect of AHRR on dioxin-related signaling is weaker for the proline allele than for the alanine allele, and that the hypomorphic function of the proline allele exerts a recessive adverse effect on male fertility.},

M bias occurs when the collider-stratification bias is transmitted through ancestors of exposure and outcome. Previous theoretical work, but not empirical data, has demonstrated that M bias is smaller than confounding bias. The authors simulated data for large cohort studies with binary exposure, an outcome, a collider, and 2 predictors of the collider. They created 178 scenarios by changing the frequencies of variables and/or the magnitudes of associations among the variables. They calculated the effect estimate, percentage bias, and mean squared error. M bias in these realistic scenarios ranged from -2\% to -5\%. When the authors increased one or both relative risks for the relation between the collider and unmeasured factors to {$\geq$}8, the negative bias was more substantial ({$>$}15\%). The result was substantially biased (e.g., {$>$}20\%) if an unmeasured confounder that was also a collider was not adjusted to avoid M bias. In scenarios resembling those the authors examined, M bias had a small impact unless associations between the collider and unmeasured confounders were very large (relative risk {$>$} 8). When a collider is itself an important confounder, controlling for confounding would take precedence over avoiding M bias.},

Gilbert (Am J Epidemiol 1991; 134:440-1) proposed that these examples occurred because the errors in exposure were systematic, and she pointed out that the relation between the measured and the true exposure was not monotonic. Assuming that the mean response either monotonically increases or decreases with the true exposure and that the exposure misclassification is nondifferential, the authors show that if the mean value of the measured exposure increases with the true exposure, then the direction of the trend cannot be reversed. Consequently, Gilbert's intimation that reversal of trend can only occur when errors are systematic is correct. However, the present authors' result is stronger in that even when errors in assessing exposure do include a systematic component, if monotonicity can be assumed, reversal of trend cannot occur. The weaker condition of positive correlation between the measured and true exposure is not sufficient to guarantee nonreversal of trend, as they show by example.},

  abstract = {Gastroschisis is a congenital abdominal wall defect, thought by many to represent a disruption in intrauterine blood flow, where there is herniation of abdominal organs. Dietary intake is an important environmental factor that has been implicated in the development of many diseases. Omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are nutrients that are substrates for eicosanoid and cytokine synthesis and prone to oxidation, and play a role in modulating inflammation, immune function, and vascular system development. This pilot case-control study explored the association of dietary intake of the omega-6 PUFA linoleic acid with risk of gastroschisis. Between 2008 and 2011, we recruited 13 pregnant women in mid-gestation who were referred to the UCSD Prenatal Center for evaluation of an abnormal alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) test and subsequently identified as carrying a baby with gastroschisis. Nine controls were selected from a false positive AFP or from the UCSD prenatal clinic. Maternal dietary intake was collected via repeated food record during the last 20 weeks of gestation. Logistic regression was used to test the association between dietary intake of linoleic acid and odds of gastroschisis. Dietary intake of linoleic acid was associated with increased odds of gastroschisis (OR = 1.72; 95\% CI: 1.08, 2.74; P = 0.02). A higher maternal intake of omega-6 PUFAs may increase the risk of having a baby with gastroschisis. The mechanism by which this occurs may be via inflammatory processes and oxidative stress leading to a vascular disruption. More research is needed including studies investigating integrated markers of PUFA status or inflammatory markers. \textcopyright{} 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract = {Numerous health consequences of children's exposure to maternal smoking have been demonstrated, including increased rates of low birth weight, infant mortality, respiratory infections, asthma, and modest impairments of cognitive development. There is little evidence, however, linking maternal smoking and increased rates of children's behavior problems. Data from the population-based National Longitudinal Survey of Youth were used to investigate the possible association of maternal smoking and behavior problems among 2256 children aged 4 through 11 years. In multiple regression analyses the authors controlled for child's race, age, sex, birth weight, and chronic asthma; family structure, income, and divorce or separation in the prior 2 years; mother's education, intelligence, self-esteem, employment status, chronic disabling health conditions, and use of alcohol during pregnancy; and the quality of the home environment as assessed by the Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment-Short Form to investigate the relationship between maternal smoking and children's behavior problems. The measure of maternal smoking status reflected two levels of smoking intensity (less than a pack per day and a pack or more per day) for each of three different categories of children's exposure: prenatal only (mother smoked only during pregnancy), passive only (mother smoked only after pregnancy), and prenatal plus passive exposure (mother smoked both during and after pregnancy). Measures of children's behavior problems included the overall score on a 32-item parent-reported child Behavior Problem Index (BPI), scores on the BPI's six subscales, and rates of extreme scores on the BPI. Increased rates of children's behavior problems were found to be independently associated with all three categories of exposure to maternal cigarette smoke, with evidence suggesting a dose-response relationship. For example, among children whose mothers smoked both during and after pregnancy, there were 1.17 additional problems independently associated with smoking less than a pack per day (P = .0007) and 2.04 additional problems associated with smoking a pack or more per day (P = .0001). The odds ratio for extreme behavior problem scores for this category of exposure was 1.41 if the mother smoked less than a pack per day (P = .01) and 1.54 if she smoked a pack or more per day (P = .02). These data provide evidence suggesting that increased behavior problems of children should be added to the growing list of adverse child health conditions associated with children's prenatal and passive exposure to maternal smoking.},

One hundred sixty-four Head Start children (44\% African American or Latino; 57\% female) were followed longitudinally. Path analyses revealed that working memory and attention control predicted growth in emergent literacy and numeracy skills during the pre-kindergarten year, and furthermore, that growth in these domain-general cognitive skills made unique contributions to the prediction of kindergarten math and reading achievement, controlling for growth in domain-specific skills. These findings extend research highlighting the importance of working memory and attention control for academic learning, demonstrating the effects in early childhood, prior to school entry. We discuss the implications of these findings for pre-kindergarten programs, particularly those designed to reduce the school readiness gaps associated with socio-economic disadvantage.},

Also, because little is known about the comparative performance of noniterative and iterative conditional expectation estimators, we explore their relative efficiency via simulation studies. Our simulations show that, in the absence of model misspecification and unmeasured confounding, our proposed iterative conditional expectation estimator and the noniterative conditional expectation estimator are similarly efficient, and that both are at least as efficient as the classical iterative conditional expectation estimator. We describe an application of both noniterative and iterative conditional expectation to answer ``when to start'' treatment questions using data from the HIV-CAUSAL Collaboration.},

We compared prenatal risk factors and birth outcomes of First Nations and M\'etis women with those of other participants in a prospective study.; Methods: During the 12-month period from July 1994 to June 1995, we invited expectant mothers in all obstetric practices affiliated with a single teaching hospital in Edmonton to participate. Women were recruited at their first prenatal visit and followed through delivery. Sociodemographic and clinical data were obtained by means of a patient questionnaire, and microbiological data were collected at 3 points during gestation: in the first and second trimesters and during labour. Our primary outcomes of interest were low birth weight (birth weight less than 2500 g), prematurity (birth at less than 37 weeks' gestation) and macrosomia (birth weight greater than 4000 g).; Results: Of the 2047 women consecutively enrolled, 1811 completed the study through delivery. Aboriginal women accounted for 70 (3.9\%) of the subjects who completed the study (45 First Nations women and 25 M\'etis women). Known risk factors for adverse pregnancy outcome were more common among Aboriginal than among non-Aboriginal women, including previous premature infant (21\% v. 11\%), smoking during the current pregnancy (41\% v. 13\%), presence of bacterial vaginosis in midgestation (33\% v. 13\%) and poor nutrition as measured by meal consumption. Although Aboriginal women were less likely than non-Aboriginal women to have babies of low birth weight (odds ratio [OR] 1.46, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.52-4.15) or who were born prematurely (OR 1.45, 95\% CI 0.57-3.72) and more likely to have babies with macrosomia (OR 2.04, 95\% CI 1.03-4.03), these differences were lower and statistically nonsignificant after adjustment for smoking, cervicovaginal infection and income (adjusted OR for low birth weight 0.85, 95\% CI 0.19-3.78; for prematurity 0.90, 95\% CI 0.21-3.89; and for macrosomia 2.12, 95\% CI 0.84-5.36).; Interpretation: After adjustment for potential confounding factors, we found no statistically significant relation between Aboriginal status and birth outcome.;},

The authors assessed whether recall bias was present in exposure information reported at postpartum interview by mothers of malformed and nonmalformed infants who delivered at Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, during 1984. Accuracy of exposure reporting was measured by comparing interview data with exposure information documented during pregnancy in obstetric records. The authors' measure of recall bias, relative sensitivity (RS), is the ratio of exposure-reporting accuracy for mothers of malformed infants to that of mothers of nonmalformed infants. Relative sensitivity estimates that are greater than 1.0 indicate that mothers of malformed infants are more accurate reporters than mothers of nonmalformed infants. Relative sensitivity was estimated for eight exposure factors: antibiotic or antifungal drug use (RS = 1.2), urinary tract or yeast infection (RS = 2.7), history of infertility (RS = 1.4), use of birth control after conception (RS = 7.6), elective abortion history (RS = 1.1), any over-the-counter drug use (RS = 1.0), spotting or bleeding (RS = 1.2), and nausea or vomiting (RS = 0.8) These data suggest the presence of recall bias for some exposure factors.

The defect is often hypothesized to result from vascular disruption in the early embryo. We measured the associations between maternal vasoactive exposures in pregnancy, as possible markers of vascular disruption, and gastroschisis risk, using data collected as part of the National Birth Defects Prevention Study. Study participants included mothers of births from October 1997 to December 2003 in 10 states. The mothers of 514 gastroschisis cases were matched by age at delivery and state to 3,277 non-malformed controls and compared for periconceptional smoking and use of vasoconstrictors, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and vasodilators. Multivariable-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated from conditional logistic regression. Case mothers were more likely than control mothers to smoke (OR = 1.5, 95\% CI = 1.2-1.9) and report use of non-aspirin NSAIDs (1.4, 1.1-1.7) and anti-hypertensive vasodilators (2.6, 0.9-8.0), but not vasoconstrictive decongestants (1.0, 0.7-1.4). Cigarette smoking had little effect on gastroschisis risk in mothers {$<$}25 years of age, but the OR was 3.0 (1.8-5.0) for those {$>$}or=25 years. Likewise, ORs were greatest in the older women for use of non-aspirin NSAIDs (1.6, 1.0-2.6) and bronchodilators (3.0, 1.8-5.0). These findings suggest that, overall, vasoactive risk factors play a minor role in the etiology of gastroschisis, and do not support the vascular disruption hypothesis. However, the observation that increased ORs for some vasoactive exposures were confined to older women raises the question of whether inherent maternal factors might influence risk.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND:The strong inverse association between maternal age and risk of gastroschisis in offspring has spurred many investigators to hypothesize that behaviors among younger females are the cause. Examples include cigarette smoking, illicit drugs, genitourinary infections, and sexually transmitted diseases, each of which has been reported to be associated with gastroschisis. Although these exposures are more common in young women, recent studies have shown that cigarette smoking, genitourinary infections, and sexually transmitted diseases are most strongly associated with gastroschisis in older women. There is both anecdotal and published evidence showing that gastroschisis sometimes (but not always) occurs in clusters, raising the possibility that an infectious agent might be involved in its pathogenesis.RESULTS:One such agent whose epidemiologic characteristics parallel those of gastroschisis is Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Primary EBV infection in early childhood has been decreasing over time, leaving a greater proportion of adolescents at risk, as reflected by increased rates of infectious mononucleosis over time. During the childbearing years, risk of primary EBV infection decreases dramatically, as does risk of gastroschisis. The stronger risks of gastroschisis associated with cigarette smoking, genitourinary infections, and sexually transmitted diseases in older women might be explained by EBV reactivation resulting from multiple challenges to immune response such as pregnancy, age, toxic exposures, and genitourinary and sexually transmitted infections.CONCLUSION:EBV and other herpes viruses should be added to the research agenda for gastroschisis.

We then evaluated 5 alternative approaches designed to correct for nonresponse bias under different attrition mechanisms, including weighting adjustments, multiple imputation, selection models, and pattern-mixture models. Nonignorable attrition in a longitudinal survey can lead to bias in estimates of change in certain health behaviors over time, and only selected procedures enable analysts to assess the sensitivity of their inferences to different assumptions about the extent of nonignorability. We compared estimates based on these 5 approaches, and we suggest a road map for assessing the risk of non-response bias in longitudinal studies. We conclude with directions for future research in this area given the results of our evaluations.},

  abstract = {Objective: To compare the incidence of hypertension, stroke, coronary heart disease, and diabetes in women who have delivered after in vitro fertilization (IVF) with those who delivered after natural conception. Design: A cohort study in Sweden between 1990 and 2008. Setting: Sweden. Patient(s): 23,498 women who had given birth to a child after IVF and 116,960 individually matched women. Intervention(s): None. Main Outcome Measure(s): Incidence rates of hypertension, diabetes, stroke, and coronary heart disease in both groups. Result(s): Inpatient and outpatient diagnoses of hypertension, stroke, coronary heart disease, and diabetes were identified by linkage to the Swedish National Patient Register. The mean time of follow-up was 8.6 years in both groups. Multivariable analysis showed that hypertension had a higher incidence in IVF mothers with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.27, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.13-1.41, as compared with mothers from the Medical Birth Register. There was a trend to a higher incidence of stroke (HR 1.27; 95\% CI, 0.96-1.68), but the incidence of coronary heart disease and diabetes did not differ. Conclusion(s): Hypertension was more prevalent in the IVF group, which suggests that these women should be aware of their blood pressure and cardiovascular risk profile.},

We present an inverse odds weighting approach that can easily operationalize transportability. We derive these weights in closed form and illustrate their use with a simple numerical example. We discuss how the conditions required for the identification of internally valid causal effects are translated to apply to the identification of externally valid causal effects. Estimating effects in target populations is an important goal, especially for policy or clinical decisions. Researchers and policy-makers should therefore consider use of statistical techniques such as inverse odds of sampling weights, which under careful assumptions can transport effect estimates from study samples to target populations.},

However, most approaches to these issues have considered external validity separately from internal validity. Here we argue that considering either internal or external validity in isolation may be problematic. Further, we argue that a joint measure of the validity of an effect estimate with respect to a specific population of interest may be more useful: We call this proposed measure target validity. In this work, we introduce and formally define target bias as the total difference between the true causal effect in the target population and the estimated causal effect in the study sample, and target validity as target bias = 0. We illustrate this measure with a series of examples and show how this measure may help us to think more clearly about comparisons between experimental and nonexperimental research results. Specifically, we show that even perfect internal validity does not ensure that a causal effect will be unbiased in a specific target population.},

Moreover, a review of the literature indicates that the positive association between spanking and child behavior problems is bidirectional for White families, whereas it is the product of reverse causation (i.e., negative child behaviors result in spanking) in Black families.

At 20 weeks old, rats were evaluated in the Morris water maze, and markers of oxidative stress and inflammation were documented in the brain. In comparison to rats fed CD, cognitive decline in HFD progeny from HFD dams manifested as a decline in retention, but not acquisition, in the water maze. HFD was also associated with significant increases in 3-nitrotyrosine, inducible nitric oxide synthase, IL-6, and glial markers Iba-1 and GFAP, with the largest increases frequently observed in HFD animals born to HFD dams. Thus, these data collectively suggest that HFD increases oxidative and inflammatory signaling in the brain, and further indicate that maternal HFD consumption might sensitize offspring to the detrimental effects of HFD.},

It can therefore be divided into two components\textemdash a predominant (Gaussian) distribution and a residual distribution. The complete distribution can be summarized by three parameters: the mean and the standard deviation of the predominant distribution, and the proportion of births in the residual distribution. This paper shows that the predominant distribution is composed largely of term births, while the residual distribu- tion is composed almost entirely of small preterm births. It also shows that the three parameters together help to explain the apparent paradox that male infants suffer a higher perinatal mortality than females despite there being fewer light male births.},

A baby's weight at birth is strongly associated with mortality risk during the first year and, to a lesser degree, with developmental problems in childhood and the risk of various diseases in adulthood. Epidemiological analyses often regard birthweight as on the causal pathway to these health outcomes. Under this assumption of causality, birthweight is used to explain variations in infant mortality and later morbidity, and is also used as an intermediate health endpoint in itself. Evidence presented here suggests the link between birthweight and health outcomes may not be causal. Methods of analysis that assume causality are unreliable at best, and biased at worst. The category of 'low birthweight' in particular is uninformative and seldom justified. The main utility of the birthweight distribution is to provide an estimate of the proportion of small preterm births in a population (although even this requires special analytical methods). While the ordinary approaches to birthweight are not well grounded, the links between birthweight and a range of health outcomes may nonetheless reflect the workings of biological mechanisms with implications for human health.},

With the exception of sucrose and total carbohydrate, nutrient intakes from the diet records tended to correlate more strongly with those computed from the questionnaire after adjustment for total caloric intake. Correlation coefficients between the mean calorie-adjusted intakes from the four one-week diet records and those from the questionnaire completed after the diet records ranged from 0.36 for vitamin A without supplements to 0.75 for vitamin C with supplements. Overall, 48\% of subjects in the lowest quintile of calorie-adjusted intake computed from the diet records were also in the lowest questionnaire quintile, and 74\% were in the lowest one of two questionnaire quintiles. Similarly, 49\% of those in the highest diet record quintile were also in the highest questionnaire quintile, and 77\% were in the highest one or two questionnaire quintiles. These data indicate that a simple self-administered dietary questionnaire can provide useful information about individual nutrient intakes over a one-year period.},

One might ask: does screen time influence childhood obesity? Could overuse of paracetamol in infancy cause wheeze? How does breastfeeding affect later cognitive outcomes? In this review, we present causal directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to a paediatric audience. DAGs are a graphical tool which provide a way to visually represent and better understand the key concepts of exposure, outcome, causation, confounding, and bias. We use clinical examples, including those outlined above, framed in the language of DAGs, to demonstrate their potential applications. We show how DAGs can be most useful in identifying confounding and sources of bias, demonstrating inappropriate statistical adjustments for presumed biases, and understanding threats to validity in randomised controlled trials. We believe that a familiarity with DAGs, and the concepts underlying them, will be of benefit both to the researchers planning studies, and~practising clinicians interpreting them.},

Singleton deliveries to AIAN and non-AIAN populations were selected from live birth-infant death cohort and fetal deaths files from 1995-1998 and 2005-2008. We examined changes over time in maternal characteristics of deliveries and disparities and changes in risks of fetal, first day ({$<$}24~h), and cause-specific deaths. We calculated descriptive statistics, odds ratios and confidence intervals, and ratio of odds ratios (RORs) to indicate changes in disparities. Along with black mothers, AIANs exhibited the highest proportion of risk factors including the highest proportion of diabetes in both time periods (4.6 and 6.5~\%). Over time, late fetal death for AIANs decreased 17~\% (aOR~=~0.83, 95~\% CI 0.72-0.97), but we noted a 47~\% increased risk over time for Hispanics (aOR~=~1.47, 95~\% CI 1.40-1.55). Our data indicated no change over time among AIANs for first day death. For AIANs compared to whites, increased risks and disparities persisted for mortality due to congenital anomalies (ROR~=~1.28, 95~\% CI 1.03-1.60). For blacks compared to AIANs, the increased risks of fetal death (2005-2008: aOR~=~0.60, 95~\% CI 0.53-0.68) persisted. For Hispanics, lower risks compared to AIANs persisted, but protective effect declined over time. Disparities between AIAN and other groups persist, but there is variability by race/ethnicity in improvement of perinatal outcomes over time. Variability in access to care and pregnancy management should be considered in relation to health equity for fetal and early infant deaths.},

  abstract = {Obtaining representative information from hidden and hard-to-reach populations is fundamental to describe the epidemiology of many sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV. Unfortunately, simple random sampling is impractical in these settings, as no registry of names exists from which to sample the population at random. However, complex sampling designs can be used, as members of these populations tend to congregate at known locations, which can be enumerated and sampled at random. For example, female sex workers may be found at brothels and street corners, whereas injection drug users often come together at shooting galleries. Despite the logistical appeal, complex sampling schemes lead to unequal probabilities of selection, and failure to account for this differential selection can result in biased estimates of population averages and relative risks. However, standard techniques to account for selection can lead to substantial losses in efficiency. Consequently, researchers implement a variety of strategies in an effort to balance validity and efficiency. Some researchers fully or partially account for the survey design, whereas others do nothing and treat the sample as a realization of the population of interest. We use directed acyclic graphs to show how certain survey sampling designs, combined with subject-matter considerations unique to individual exposure-outcome associations, can induce selection bias. Finally, we present a novel yet simple maximum likelihood approach for analyzing complex survey data; this approach optimizes statistical efficiency at no cost to validity. We use simulated data to illustrate this method and compare it with other analytic techniques.},

Methods We recruited female participants age 21-45 and their male partners through Internet advertisements, word of mouth, and flyers. Female participants were randomised with 50\% probability to receive a subscription to FertilityFriend.com (FF), a web-based programme that collects real-time data on menstrual characteristics. We compared recruitment methods within PRESTO, assessed the cost-efficiency of PRESTO relative to its Danish counterpart (Snart-Gravid), and validated retrospectively reported date of last menstrual period (LMP) against the FF data. Results After 99 weeks of recruitment (2013-15), 2421 women enrolled; 1384 (57\%) invited their male partners to participate, of whom 693 (50\%) enrolled. Baseline characteristics were balanced across randomisation groups. Cohort retention was similar among those randomised vs. not randomised to FF (84\% vs. 81\%). At study enrolment, 56\%, 22\%, and 22\% couples had been trying to conceive for {$<$}3, 3-5, and {$\geq$}6 months, respectively. The cost per subject enrolled was \$146 (2013 US\$), which was similar to our companion Danish study and half that of a traditional cohort study. Among FF users who conceived, {$>$}97\% reported their LMP on the PRESTO questionnaire within 1 day of the LMP recorded via FF. Conclusions Use of the Internet as a method of recruitment and follow-up in a North American preconception cohort study was feasible and cost-effective.},

  abstract = {Analyses of causal mediation are often complicated by treatment-induced confounders of the mediator\textendash outcome relationship. In the presence of such confounders, the natural direct and indirect effects of treatment on the outcome, into which the total effect can be additively decomposed, are not identified. An alternative but similar set of effects, known as randomized intervention analogues to the natural direct effect (rNDE) and the natural indirect effect (rNIE), can still be identified in this situation, but existing estimators for these effects require a complicated weighting procedure that is difficult to use in practice. We introduce a new method for estimating the rNDE and rNIE that involves only a minor adaptation of the comparatively simple regression methods used to perform effect decomposition in the absence of treatment-induced confounding. It involves fitting (a) a generalized linear model for the conditional mean of the mediator given treatment and a set of baseline confounders and (b) a linear model for the conditional mean of the outcome given the treatment, mediator, baseline confounders, and a set of treatment-induced confounders that have been residualized with respect to the observed past. The rNDE and rNIE are simple functions of the parameters in these models when they are correctly specified and when there are no unobserved variables that confound the treatment\textendash outcome, treatment\textendash mediator, or mediator\textendash outcome relationships. We illustrate the method by decomposing the effect of education on depression at midlife into components operating through income versus alternative factors. R and Stata packages are available for implementing the proposed method.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To investigate the pattern of weight perception and its relationship with psychological distress among Chinese adolescents. METHODS: A sub-cohort of 2179 healthy Chinese adolescents randomly selected from schools in Wuhan, China, including 1156 boys and 1023 girls 11 to 15 years of age was included in the current study. Weight, height, self-perceptions of weight status, depressive psychological symptoms including anxiety, depression, perceived peer isolation, and other constructs were measured by a structured questionnaire. A General Linear Model was used to compare psychological differences between actual and perceived weight groups. RESULTS: Perceived underweight was more likely to occur in boys, whereas perceived overweight was more likely to occur in girls. Compared with objective body weight status defined by the International Obesity Task Force (IOTF) and the World Health Organization (WHO) age- and gender-specific body mass index (BMI) cutoffs, girls were more likely to misperceive themselves as overweight, whereas relatively more boys misclassified their weight status as underweight. After adjusting for age, parents' educational attainment, and urban residence, perceived overweight boys and girls were more likely to experience anxiety and depression than perceived normal and underweight subjects (p {$<$}.05). Perceived overweight girls and perceived underweight boys experienced higher peer isolation than other groups (p {$<$}.05). Significant differences were not found in social support, school connectedness, trouble with teachers, and family disharmony among different weight-perception groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggested distortion of weight perception was prevalent, and may have detrimental psychological influences in Chinese adolescents},

In contrast to machine learning methods that only leverage text features or raw text for sentiment analysis, methods that use sentiment lexicons embrace higher interpretability. Although a number of domain-specific sentiment lexicons are made available, it is impractical to build an ex ante lexicon that fully reflects the characteristics of the language usage in endless domains. In this article, we propose a novel approach to simultaneously train a vanilla sentiment classifier and adapt word polarities to the target domain. Specifically, we sequentially track the wrongly predicted sentences and use them as the supervision instead of addressing the gold standard as a whole to emulate the life-long cognitive process of lexicon learning. An exploration-exploitation mechanism is designed to trade off between searching for new sentiment words and updating the polarity score of one word. Experimental results on several popular datasets show that our approach significantly improves the sentiment classification performance for a variety of domains by means of improving the quality of sentiment lexicons. Case-studies also illustrate how polarity scores of the same words are discovered for different domains.},

The authors derive a method for estimating sample size requirements, present sample size estimates, and compare minimum sample size requirements to detect gene-environment interaction in case-only studies with case-control studies. Assuming independence between exposure and genotype in the population, the authors believe that the case-only design is more efficient than a case-control design in detecting gene-environment interaction.

Women were considered exposed if they reported at least 1 instance of a GUI in the first trimester. Logistic regression models were used to calculate odds ratios and 95\% confidence intervals. Women who reported having any GUI had an adjusted odds ratio of 1.8 (95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.3, 2.4). The highest risk was seen among women who reported a UTI only (adjusted odds ratio = 2.3, 95\% CI: 1.5, 3.5), while the odds ratio for an STD only was slightly elevated (adjusted odds ratio = 1.2, 95\% CI: 1.0, 1.5). Among women under 25 years of age, the odds ratio for UTI only was 2.6 (95\% CI: 1.7, 4.0), and among older women it was 1.8 (95\% CI: 0.6, 5.9). When we considered the joint association of UTIs and young maternal age, a synergistic effect was observed. The results of this study add further evidence that UTIs may increase the risk of gastroschisis.},

  abstract = {Ideally, randomized trials would be used to compare the long-term effectiveness of dynamic treatment regimes on clinically relevant outcomes. However, because randomized trials are not always feasible or timely, we often must rely on observational data to compare dynamic treatment regimes. An example of a dynamic treatment regime is "start combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) within 6 months of CD4 cell count first dropping below x cells/mm3 or diagnosis of an AIDS-defining illness, whichever happens first" where x can take values between 200 and 500. Recently, Cain et al (2011) used inverse probability (IP) weighting of dynamic marginal structural models to find the x that minimizes 5-year mortality risk under similar dynamic regimes using observational data. Unlike standard methods, IP weighting can appropriately adjust for measured time-varying confounders (e.g., CD4 cell count, viral load) that are affected by prior treatment. Here we describe an alternative method to IP weighting for comparing the effectiveness of dynamic cART regimes: the parametric g-formula. The parametric g-formula naturally handles dynamic regimes and, like IP weighting, can appropriately adjust for measured time-varying confounders. However, estimators based on the parametric g-formula are more efficient than IP weighted estimators. This is often at the expense of more parametric assumptions. Here we describe how to use the parametric g-formula to estimate risk by the end of a user-specified follow-up period under dynamic treatment regimes. We describe an application of this method to answer the "when to start" question using data from the HIV-CAUSAL Collaboration.},

  abstract = {Robins et al. (2004, Comparative Quantification of Health Risks: Global and Regional Burden of Disease Attributable to Selected Major Risk Factors. Geneva: World Health Organization) introduced the extended g-formula to estimate from observational data the risk of failure under hypothetical interventions wherein a subject's treatment at time k is assigned based on the natural value of treatment at k; that is, the value of treatment that would have been observed at k were the intervention discontinued right before k. Several authors have parametrically applied the extended g-formula to estimate long-term failure risk under hypothetical interventions on time-varying behaviors in observational studies. For example, Taubman et al. (2009, Intervening on risk factors for coronary heart disease: an application of the parametric g-formula. International Journal of Epidemiology, 380(6):1599-1611) used this approach to estimate the 20-year risk of coronary heart disease in the Nurses' Health Study under the hypothetical intervention "If a subject's natural value of exercise by the end of day k is less than 30 minutes, set her exercise on day k to exactly 30 minutes; otherwise, do not intervene on her on that day". Non-parametrically, the extended g-formula differs from the (non-extended) g-formula of Robins (1986, A new approach to causal inference in mortality studies with a sustained exposure period: application to the healthy worker survivor effect. Mathematical Modelling, 7:1393-1512) in that it is a function of (i) a user-specified intervention depending on the natural value of treatment and (ii) the distribution of natural treatment itself. Richardson and Robins (2013, http://www.csss.washington.edu/Papers/) recently defined a sufficient condition such that the extended g-formula may identify risk under an intervention that depends on the natural value of treatment, provided this expression is well-defined. In this paper, we complement this result by showing that the extended g-formula associated with an intervention depending on the natural value of treatment is algebraically equivalent to the (non-extended) g-formula associated with a particular random dynamic regime that does not depend on this value. Using previous results for random dynamic regimes, we show that this equivalence immediately gives a sufficient positivity condition that guarantees the extended g-formula is well-defined as well as semi-parametric alternatives to the parametric extended g-formula for estimation. Finally, given a hypothetical intervention that depends on the natural value of treatment, we define a plausible (implementable) approximation to this hypothetical intervention along with an untestable assumption that gives exact equivalence.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Randomized trials are considered the gold standard for making inferences about the causal effects of treatments. However, when protocol deviations occur, the baseline randomization of the trial is no longer sufficient to ensure unbiased estimation of the per-protocol effect: post-randomization, time-varying confounders must be sufficiently measured and adjusted for in the analysis. Given the historical emphasis on intention-to-treat effects in randomized trials, measurement of post-randomization confounders is typically infrequent. This may induce bias in estimates of the per-protocol effect, even using methods such as inverse probability weighting, which appropriately account for time-varying confounders affected by past treatment. METHODS/DESIGN In order to concretely illustrate the potential magnitude of bias due to infrequent measurement of time-varying covariates, we simulated data from a very large trial with a survival outcome and time-varying confounding affected by past treatment. We generated the data such that the true underlying per-protocol effect is null and under varying degrees of confounding (strong, moderate, weak). In the simulated data, we estimated per-protocol survival curves and associated contrasts using inverse probability weighting under monthly measurement of the time-varying covariates (which constituted complete measurement in our simulation), yearly measurement, as well as 3- and 6-month intervals. RESULTS Using inverse probability weighting, we were able to recover the true null under the complete measurement scenario no matter the strength of confounding. Under yearly measurement intervals, the estimate of the per-protocol effect diverged from the null; inverse probability weighted estimates of the per-protocol 5-year risk ratio based on yearly measurement were 1.19, 1.12, and 1.03 under strong, moderate, and weak confounding, respectively. Bias decreased with measurement interval length. Under all scenarios, inverse probability weighted estimators were considerably less biased than a naive estimator that ignored time-varying confounding completely. CONCLUSIONS Bias that arises from interval measurement designs highlights the need for planning in the design of randomized trials for collection of time-varying covariate data. This may come from more frequent in-person measurement or external sources (e.g., electronic medical record data). Such planning will provide improved estimates of the per-protocol effect through the use of methods that appropriately adjust for time-varying confounders.},

  abstract = {In failure-time settings, a competing event is any event that makes it impossible for the event of interest to occur. For example, cardiovascular disease death is a competing event for prostate cancer death because an individual cannot die of prostate cancer once he has died of cardiovascular disease. Various statistical estimands have been defined as possible targets of inference in the classical competing risks literature. Many reviews have described these statistical estimands and their estimating procedures with recommendations about their use. However, this previous work has not used a formal framework for characterizing causal effects and their identifying conditions, which makes it difficult to interpret effect estimates and assess recommendations regarding analytic choices. Here we use a counterfactual framework to explicitly define each of these classical estimands. We clarify that, depending on whether competing events are defined as censoring events, contrasts of risks can define a total effect of the treatment on the event of interest or a direct effect of the treatment on the event of interest not mediated by the competing event. In contrast, regardless of whether competing events are defined as censoring events, counterfactual hazard contrasts cannot generally be interpreted as causal effects. We illustrate how identifying assumptions for all of these counterfactual estimands can be represented in causal diagrams, in which competing events are depicted as time-varying covariates. We present an application of these ideas to data from a randomized trial designed to estimate the effect of estrogen therapy on prostate cancer mortality.},

We investigated the feasibility and effectiveness of the integration of interventions to enhance child development and growth outcomes in the Lady Health Worker (LHW) programme in Sindh, Pakistan.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nMETHODS: We implemented a community-based cluster-randomised effectiveness trial through the LHW programme in rural Sindh, Pakistan, with a 2\hphantom{,}\texttimes\hphantom{,}2 factorial design. We randomly allocated 80 clusters (LHW catchments) of children to receive routine health and nutrition services (controls; n=368), nutrition education and multiple micronutrient powders (enhanced nutrition; n=364), responsive stimulation (responsive stimulation; n=383), or a combination of both enriched interventions (n=374). The allocation ratio was 1:20 (ie, 20 clusters per intervention group). The data collection team were masked to the allocated intervention. All children born in the study area between April, 2009, and March, 2010, were eligible for enrolment if they were up to 2{$\cdot$}5 months old without signs of severe impairments. Interventions were delivered by LHWs to families with children up to 24 months of age in routine monthly group sessions and home visits. The primary endpoints were child development at 12 and 24 months of age (assessed with the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Third Edition) and growth at 24 months of age. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT007159636.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nFINDINGS: 1489 mother-infant dyads were enrolled into the study, of whom 1411 (93\%) were followed up until the children were 24 months old. Children who received responsive stimulation had significantly higher development scores on the cognitive, language, and motor scales at 12 and 24 months of age, and on the social-emotional scale at 12 months of age, than did those who did not receive the intervention. Children who received enhanced nutrition had significantly higher development scores on the cognitive, language, and social-emotional scales at 12 months of age than those who did not receive this intervention, but at 24 months of age only the language scores remained significantly higher. We did not record any additive benefits when responsive stimulation was combined with nutrition interventions. Responsive stimulation effect sizes (Cohen's d) were 0{$\cdot$}6 for cognition, 0{$\cdot$}7 for language, and 0{$\cdot$}5 for motor development at 24 months of age; these effect sizes were slightly smaller for the combined intervention group and were low to moderate for the enhanced nutrition intervention alone. Children exposed to enhanced nutrition had significantly better height-for-age Z scores at 6 months (p{$<$}0{$\cdot$}0001) and 18 months (p=0{$\cdot$}02) than did children not exposed to enhanced nutrition. Longitudinal analysis showed a small benefit to linear growth from enrolment to 24 months (p=0{$\cdot$}026) in the children who received the enhanced nutrition intervention.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nINTERPRETATION: The responsive stimulation intervention can be delivered effectively by LHWs and positively affects development outcomes. The absence of a major effect of the enhanced nutrition intervention on growth shows the need for further analysis of mediating variables (eg, household food security status) that will help to optimise future nutrition implementation design.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nFUNDING: UNICEF.},

  abstract = {Recently, attention has focused on whether particulate air pollution is a specific trigger of myocardial infarction (MI). The results of several studies of single locations assessing the effects of ambient particular matter on the risk of MI have been disparate. We used a multicity case-crossover study to examine risk of emergency hospitalization associated with fine particulate matter (PM) with aerodynamic diameter {$<$} 10 mu m (PM10) for {$>$} 300,000 MIs during 1985-1999 among elderly residents of 21 U.S. cities. We used time-stratified controls matched on day of the week or on temperature to detect possible residual confounding by weather. Overall, we found a 0.65\% [95\% confidence interval (0), 0.3-1.0\%] increased risk of hospitalization for MI per 10 mu g/m(3) increase in ambient PM10 concentration. Matching on apparent temperature yielded a 0.64\% increase in risk (95\% CI, 0.1-1.2\%). We found that the effect size for PM10 doubled for subjects with a previous admission for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or a secondary diagnosis of pneumonia, although these differences did not achieve statistical significance. There was a weaker indication of a larger effect on males but no evidence of effect modification by age or the other diagnoses. We also found that the shape of the exposure-response relationship between MI hospitalizations and PM10 is almost linear, but with a steeper slope at levels of PM10 {$<$} 50 mu g/m(3). We conclude that increased concentrations of ambient PM10 are associated with increased risk of MI among the elderly.},

  abstract = {Fetal progenitor cells proliferate, migrate, differentiate and undergo apoptosis at specific times during fetal development. Choline is needed by these cells for membrane synthesis and for methylation. There is growing evidence that this nutrient also modulates epigenetic regulation of gene expression in both neuronal and endothelial progenitor cells, thereby modifying brain development. It is likely that these mechanisms explain why, in rodent models, maternal dietary intake of choline influences both angiogenesis and neurogenesis in fetal hippocampus, and results in life-long changes in memory function. This also may explain why women eating diets low in choline have a greater risk of having a baby with a birth defect. Choline is mainly found in foods that contain fat and cholesterol, and intake of such foods has diminished in response dietary advice from nutritionists and physicians. Forty years ago, diets commonly contained choline-rich foods but now women in the USA tend to eat diets low in choline content. Premenopausal women normally may require less choline in their diet than do men and postmenopausal women, because estrogen induces the gene for the enzyme catalyzing endogenous biosynthesis of the choline-containing phospholipid phosphatidylcholine. However, many women have a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) that blocks the induction of endogenous biosynthesis, thereby making them require more dietary choline. When these women eat diets low in choline, the supply of this nutrient to the fetus is likely to be inadequate, and may perturb progenitor cell proliferation, migration, differentiation and apoptosis. \textcopyright{} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {A common goal of epidemiologic research is to study the association between a certain exposure and a certain outcome, while controlling for important covariates. This is often done by fitting a restricted mean model for the outcome, as in generalized linear models (GLMs) and in generalized estimating equations (GEEs). If the covariates are high-dimensional, then it may be difficult to well specify the model. This is an important concern, since model misspecification may lead to biased estimates. Doubly robust estimation is an estimation technique that offers some protection against model misspecification. It utilizes two models, one for the outcome and one for the exposure, and produces unbiased estimates of the exposure-outcome association if either model is correct, not necessarily both. Despite its obvious appeal, doubly robust estimation is not used on a regular basis in applied epidemiologic research. One reason for this could be the lack of up-to-date software. In this paper we describe a new R package, drgee, which carries out doubly robust estimation in restricted mean models. The package is constructed to be user-friendly and fast, to facilitate routine use of doubly robust estimation. The paper is structured into theory sections and example sections. The former are intended to serve as a brief but self-consistent tutorial in doubly robust estimation. The latter illustrate the use of the drgee package through practical examples. We have used publically available data throughout the paper, so that the reader can easily replicate all examples.},

The goal is to accommodate heterogeneity among patients and find the DTR which will produce the best long term outcome if implemented. We introduce two new statistical learning methods for estimating the optimal DTR, termed backward outcome weighted learning (BOWL), and simultaneous outcome weighted learning (SOWL). These approaches convert individualized treatment selection into an either sequential or simultaneous classification problem, and can thus be applied by modifying existing machine learning techniques. The proposed methods are based on directly maximizing over all DTRs a nonparametric estimator of the expected long-term outcome; this is fundamentally different than regression-based methods, for example Q-learning, which indirectly attempt such maximization and rely heavily on the correctness of postulated regression models. We prove that the resulting rules are consistent, and provide finite sample bounds for the errors using the estimated rules. Simulation results suggest the proposed methods produce superior DTRs compared with Q- learning especially in small samples. We illustrate the methods using data from a clinical trial for smoking cessation. Keywords},

Early estimates of the epidemic growth and incubation period of COVID-19 may have been biased due to sample selection. Using detailed case reports from 14 locations in and outside mainland China, we obtained 378 Wuhan-exported cases who left Wuhan before an abrupt travel quarantine. We developed a generative model we call BETS for four key epidemiological events---Beginning of exposure, End of exposure, time of Transmission, and time of Symptom onset (BETS)---and derived explicit formulas to correct for the sample selection. We gave a detailed illustration of why some early and highly influential analyses of the COVID-19 pandemic were severely biased. All our analyses, regardless of which subsample and model were being used, point to an epidemic doubling time of 2 to 2.5 days during the early outbreak in Wuhan. A Bayesian nonparametric analysis further suggests that about 5\% of the symptomatic cases may not develop symptoms within 14 days of infection and that men may be much more likely than women to develop symptoms within 2 days of infection.},

A central challenge is that not all police-civilian encounters are recorded in administrative datasets and available to researchers. One possible solution is to consider the average causal effect of race conditional on the civilian already being detained by the police. We find that such an estimand can be quite different from the more familiar ones in causal inference and needs to be interpreted with caution. We propose using an estimand new for this context---the causal risk ratio, which has more transparent interpretation and requires weaker identification assumptions. We demonstrate this through a reanalysis of the NYPD Stop-and-Frisk dataset. Our reanalysis shows that the naive estimator that ignores the post-treatment selection in administrative records may severely underestimate the disparity in police violence between minorities and whites in these and similar data.},

STUDY DESIGN: We used data from the US Collaborative Perinatal Project (1959-66), a multicenter, prospective cohort of almost 60,000 pregnancies. Analysis was restricted to live-born term singletons with birthweights 2500-4200g. Major congenital anomalies and neonatal morbidities, genetic syndromes, newborn endocrine disorders, parental intellectual disability, maternal substance abuse, and maternal thyroid disorders were excluded. Using pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI, kg/m2), subjects were grouped according to the 2009 IOM classification of underweight ({$<$}18.5), normal weight (18.5-24.9), overweight (25-29.9), and obese ({$>$}30). Gestational weight gain was categorized according to pre-pregnancy BMI and IOM guidelines: Under Goal, At Goal, and Over Goal. Within each BMI group, offspring Stanford-Binet IQ at age 4 was compared between weight gain groups using At Goal weight gain as the reference. Analyses were adjusted for smoking, breastfeeding, socioeconomic index, income, race and maternal education. RESULTS: Mean offspring IQ of normal weight women (98.9+/-16.4) was significantly higher than underweight (97.2+/-15.6), overweight (95.8+/-15), and obese (95.5+/-14.9) women (P{$<$}0.0001). In all BMI groups, except underweight, there was a decrease in offspring IQ with inappropriate weight gain(Table 1). Adjusted analysis showed a significant decrease in offspring IQ with Over Goal weight gain in the normal and overweight groups, whereas Under Goal weight gain among obese women resulted in a higher offspring IQ(Fig 1). Gestational weight gain still did not affect 4 year IQ among underweight women. CONCLUSION: In this historical cohort, excessive gestational weight gain in normal, overweight, and obese women had an adverse impact on offspring IQ at age 4. Further research with a contemporary cohort is needed to validate these findings. (Figure presented).},
