abstract = {Objective: EORTC trial 30891 compared immediate versus deferred androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) in T0-4 N0-2 M0 prostate cancer (PCa). Many patients randomly assigned to deferred ADT did not require ADT because they died before becoming symptomatic. The question arises whether serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels may be used to decide when to initiate ADT in PCa not suitable for local curative treatment. Methods: PSA data at baseline, PSA doubling time (PSADT) in patients receiving no ADT, and time to PSA relapse ({\textgreater}2 ng/ml) in patients whose PSA declined to {\textless}2 ng/ml within the first year after immediate ADT were analyzed in 939 eligible patients randomly assigned to immediate (n = 468) or deferred ADT (n = 471). Results: In both arms, patients with a baseline PSA {\textgreater} 50 ng/ml were at a {\textgreater} 3.5-fold higher risk to die of PCa than patients with a baseline PSA ≤ 8 ng/ml. If baseline PSA was between 8 and 50 ng/ml, the risk of PCa death was approximately 7.5-fold higher in patients with PSADT {\textless} 12 mo than in patients with PSADT {\textgreater} 12 mo. Time to PSA relapse after response to immediate ADT correlated significantly with baseline PSA, suggesting that baseline PSA may also reflect disease aggressiveness. Conclusions: Patients with a baseline PSA {\textgreater} 50 ng/ml and/or a PSADT {\textless} 12 mo were at increased risk to die from PCa and might have benefited from immediate ADT, whereas patients with a baseline PSA {\textless} 50 ng/ml and a slow PSADT ({\textgreater}12 mo) were likely to die of causes unrelated to PCa, and thus could be spared the burden of immediate ADT. {\textcopyright} 2007 European Association of Urology.},

abstract = {The Polyvagal Theory introduced a new perspective relating autonomic function to behavior that included an appreciation of autonomic nervous system as a “system,” the identification of neural circuits involved in the regulation of autonomic state, and an interpretation of autonomic reactivity as adaptive within the context of the phylogeny of the vertebrate autonomic nervous system. The paper has two objectives: First, to provide an explicit statement of the theory; and second, to introduce the features of a polyvagal perspective. The polyvagal perspective emphasizes how an understanding of neurophysiological mechanisms and phylogenetic shifts in neural regulation, leads to different questions, paradigms, explanations, and conclusions regarding autonomic function in biobehavioral processes than peripheral models. Foremost, the polyvagal perspective emphasizes the importance of phylogenetic changes in the neural structures regulating the autonomic nervous system and how these phylogenetic shifts provide insights into the adaptive function and the neural regulation of the two vagal systems.},

abstract = {There has been considerable interest in using decomposition methods in epidemiology (mediation analysis) and economics (Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition) to understand how health disparities arise and how they might change upon intervention. It has not been clear when estimates from the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition can be interpreted causally because its implementation does not explicitly address potential confounding of target variables. While mediation analysis does explicitly adjust for confounders of target variables, it does so in a way that entails equalizing confounders across racial groups, which may not reflect the intended intervention. Revisiting prior analyses in the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth on disparities in wages, unemployment, incarceration, and overall health with test scores, taken as a proxy for educational attainment, as a target intervention, we propose and demonstrate a novel decomposition that controls for confounders of test scores (measures of childhood SES) while leaving their association with race intact. We compare this decomposition with others that use standardization (to equalize childhood SES alone), mediation analysis (to equalize test scores within levels of childhood SES), and one that equalizes both childhood SES and test scores. We also show how these decompositions, including our novel proposals, are equivalent to causal implementations of the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition.},

abstract = {Causal decomposition analyses can contribute to the evidence base for interventions that address health inequities. Through study design and assumptions, they rule out alternate explanations such as confounding, selection-bias, and measurement error. However, their practical use is impeded by critical challenges. First, current approaches pay little attention to what variables a disparity measure itself should condition on or standardize over. Second, current approaches have ignored what hypothetical interventions should condition on and thus may not reflect equity concerns that actual interventionists would respect. Third, there are several estimators across the epidemiology and economics literature but their incorporation of equity value judgements has not been examined, and these do not cover many of the ways in which disparities and hypothetical interventions may be defined. In this paper, motivated by the clinical example of treatment intensification and hypertension control disparities, we address these issues of defining and estimating meaningful causal decompositions. We present a framework that explicitly considers what the disparity measure and hypothetical intervention account for and how these choices can be mapped to notions of equity. For these general estimands we provide identifying assumptions and estimators based on adaptations of ratio-of-mediator probability and inverse-odds-ratio weighting and evaluate their statistical performance.},

abstract = {Ideally, randomized trials would be used to compare the long-term effectiveness of dynamic treatment regimes on clinically relevant outcomes. However, because randomized trials are not always feasible or timely, we often must rely on observational data to compare dynamic treatment regimes. An example of a dynamic treatment regime is "start combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) within 6 months of CD4 cell count first dropping below x cells/mm3 or diagnosis of an AIDS-defining illness, whichever happens first" where x can take values between 200 and 500. Recently, Cain et al (2011) used inverse probability (IP) weighting of dynamic marginal structural models to find the x that minimizes 5-year mortality risk under similar dynamic regimes using observational data. Unlike standard methods, IP weighting can appropriately adjust for measured time-varying confounders (e.g., CD4 cell count, viral load) that are affected by prior treatment. Here we describe an alternative method to IP weighting for comparing the effectiveness of dynamic cART regimes: the parametric g-formula. The parametric g-formula naturally handles dynamic regimes and, like IP weighting, can appropriately adjust for measured time-varying confounders. However, estimators based on the parametric g-formula are more efficient than IP weighted estimators. This is often at the expense of more parametric assumptions. Here we describe how to use the parametric g-formula to estimate risk by the end of a user-specified follow-up period under dynamic treatment regimes. We describe an application of this method to answer the "when to start" question using data from the HIV-CAUSAL Collaboration.},

abstract = {Context: In men who develop an elevated serum prostate-specific antigen level (PSA) after having undergone a radical prostatectomy, the natural history of progression to distant metastases and death due to prostate cancer is unknown. Objective: To characterize the time course of disease progression in men with biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy. Design: A retrospective review of a large surgical series with median (SD) follow-up of 5.3 (3.7) years (range, 0.5-15 years) between April 1982 and April 1997. Setting: An urban academic tertiary referral institution. Patients: A total of 1997 men undergoing radical prostatectomy, by a single surgeon, for clinically localized prostate cancer. None received neoadjuvant therapy, and none had received adjuvant hormonal therapy prior to documented distant metastases. Main Outcome Measures: After surgery, men were followed up with PSA assays and digital rectal examinations every 3 months for the first year, semiannually for the second year, and annually thereafter. A detectable serum PSA level of at least 0.2 ng/mL was evidence of biochemical recurrence. Distant metastases were diagnosed by radionuclide bone scan, chest radiograph, or other body imaging, which was performed at the time of biochemical recurrence and annually thereafter. Results: The actuarial metastasis-free survival for all 1997 men was 82{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval, 76{\%}-88{\%}) at 15 years after surgery. Of the 1997 men, 315 (15{\%}) developed biochemical PSA level elevation. Eleven of these underwent early hormone therapy after the recurrence and are not included in the study. Of the remaining 304 men, 103 (34{\%}) developed metastatic disease within the study period. The median actuarial time to metastases was 8 years from the time of PSA level elevation. In survival analysis, time to biochemical progression (P{\textless}.001), Gleason score (P{\textless}.001), and PSA doubling time (P{\textless}.001) were predictive of the probability and time to the development of metastatic disease. An algorithm combining these parameters was constructed to stratify men into risk groups. Once men developed metastatic disease, the median actuarial time to death was 5 years. The time interval from surgery to the appearance of metastatic disease was predictive of time until death (P{\textless}.02). Conclusions: Several clinical parameters help predict the outcomes of men with PSA elevation after radical prostatectomy. These data may be useful in the design of clinical trials, the identification of men for enrollment into experimental protocols, and counseling men regarding the timing of administration of adjuvant therapies.},

abstract = {Depressive symptomatology can proceed from altered hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortex (HPA)-axis function. Some authors stress the role that early life stress (ELS) may play in the pathophysiology of depressive symptoms. However, the involvement of the HPA-axis in linking prenatal ELS with depressive symptoms has not been tested in a prospective-longitudinal study extending until after puberty in humans. Therefore, we examined whether antenatal maternal anxiety is associated with disturbances in HPA-axis regulation and whether the HPA-axis dysregulation mediates the association between antenatal maternal anxiety and depressive symptoms in post-pubertal adolescents. As part of a prospective-longitudinal study, we investigated maternal anxiety at 12–22, 23–32, and 32–40 weeks of pregnancy (wp) with the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). In the 14–15-year-old offspring (n ¼ 58) HPA-axis function was measured through establishing a saliva cortisol day-time profile. Depressive symptoms were measured with the Children's Depression symptoms Inventory (CDI). Results of regression analyses showed that antenatal exposure to maternal anxiety at 12–22 wp was in both sexes associated with a high, flattened cortisol day-time profile (P ¼ 0.0463) which, in female adolescents only, was associated with depressive symptoms (P ¼ 0.0077). All effects remained after controlling for maternal smoking, birth weight, obstetrical optimality, maternal postnatal anxiety and puberty phase. Our prospective study demonstrates, for the first time, the involvement of the HPA-axis in the link between antenatal maternal anxiety/prenatal ELS and depressive symptoms for post-pubertal female adolescents.

abstract = {Excessive gestational weight gain and obesity have been recognized as independent risk factors for maternal and fetal complications of pregnancy with significant lifelong consequences. These associations call into question the recently released Institute of Medicine (IOM) gestational weight gain recommendations, particularly for obese women. The IOM recommendation of a single standard of weight gain for all obesity classes is also of concern, because higher body mass index levels are associated with more severe pregnancy complications, such as preeclampsia and gestational diabetes. The IOM recommendations retained the 1990 focus on the theoretical association between poor gestational weight gain and low birth weight (LBW). Low gestational weight gain may often be a consequence and not the cause of LBW, and there is a lack of evidence in developed countries that dietary supplementation increases birth weight. Current obstetric practice allows for accurate and timely diagnosis of and intervention for LBW. We submit that gestational weight gain recommendations should be more individualized especially for obese women. Obese pregnant women should not be precluded from partaking in healthy lifestyle modifications in pregnancy that include physical activities, modified, judicious diets, and limited weight gain.},

For these children the psycho-educational secondary prevention program 'En nu ik...!' ('It's my turn now!') has been developed. This program includes specific therapeutic factors focused on emotion awareness and expression, increasing feelings of emotional security, teaching specific coping strategies, developing a trauma narrative, improving parent-child interaction and psycho-education. The main study aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of the specific therapeutic factors in the program. A secondary objective is to study mediating and moderating factors.Methods/design: This study is a prospective multicenter randomized controlled trial across cities in the Netherlands. Participants (N = 140) are referred to the secondary preventive intervention program by police, social work, women shelters and youth (mental health) care. Children, aged 6-12 years, and their parents, who experienced interparental violence are randomly assigned to either the intervention program or the control program. The control program is comparable on nonspecific factors by offering positive attention, positive expectations, recreation, distraction, warmth and empathy of the therapist, and social support among group participants, in ways that are similar to the intervention program. Primary outcome measures are posttraumatic stress symptoms and emotional and behavioral problems of the child. Mediators tested are the ability to differentiate and express emotions, emotional security, coping strategies, feelings of guilt and parent-child interaction. Mental health of the parent, parenting stress, disturbances in parent-child attachment, duration and severity of the domestic violence and demographics are examined for their moderating effect. Data are collected one week before the program starts (T1), and one week (T2) and six months (T3) after finishing the program. Both intention-to-treat and completer analyses will be done.Discussion: Adverse outcomes after witnessing interparental violence are highly diverse and may be explained by multiple risk factors. An important question for prevention programs is therefore to what extent a specific focus on potential psychotrauma is useful. This trial may point to several directions for optimizing public health response to children's exposure to interparental violence.Trial registration: Netherlands Trial Register (NTR): NTR3064. {\textcopyright} 2012 Overbeek et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {Marked circannual variation in the incidence of preterm birth, adjusted for the normal seasonal fertility rate, was observed in data from the Collaborative Perinatal Project collected at 12 urban university centers during 1959–1966 (p{\textless}10−5). The variation in monthly preterm birth rates ranged from a trough of 64{\%} in May to a peak of 144{\%} in September. This is considerably greater seasonal variation than found in most previous studies, which used differing definitions of prematurity. The seasonal trend was present for maternal age groups 22–26 years (p{\textless}0.005) and greater than 26 years (p{\textless}0.005), for Bureau of the Census socioeconomic index 3.6–4.9 (p{\textless}10−4) and greater than 4.9 (p{\textless}0.01), for those living in northern states (p{\textless}10−4) for married gravidas (p{\textless}10−6) for blacks (p{\textless}0.05) and whites (p{\textless}0.001), but not for those less than age 22, those with socioeconomic index less than 3.6, those living in southern states, and those not married. Thus, preterm birth was seasonal in the population studied, and the seasonal factor was more evident in demographic groups less predisposed to deliver preterm. These findings may have implications for the pathogenesis of a portion of premature deliveries, and should be considered in the design of studies related to the pathogenesis of preterm birth.},

abstract = {Many modern estimators require bootstrapping to calculate confidence intervals because either no analytic standard error is available or the distribution of the parameter of interest is non-symmetric. It remains however unclear how to obtain valid bootstrap inference when dealing with multiple imputation to address missing data. We present four methods which are intuitively appealing, easy to implement, and combine bootstrap estimation with multiple imputation. We show that three of the four approaches yield valid inference, but that the performance of the methods varies with respect to the number of imputed data sets and the extent of missingness. Simulation studies reveal the behavior of our approaches in finite samples. A topical analysis from HIV treatment research, which determines the optimal timing of antiretroviral treatment initiation in young children, demonstrates the practical implications of the four methods in a sophisticated and realistic setting. This analysis suffers from missing data and uses the {\$}g{\$}-formula for inference, a method for which no standard errors are available.},

abstract = {Background: Uncertain validity of epilepsy diagnoses within health insurance claims and other large datasets have hindered efforts to study and monitor care at the population level. Objectives: To develop and validate prediction models using longitudinal Medicare administrative data to identify patients with actual epilepsy among those with the diagnosis. Research Design, Subjects, Measures: We used linked electronic health records and Medicare administrative data including claims to predict epilepsy status. A neurologist reviewed electronic health record data to assess epilepsy status in a stratified random sample of Medicare beneficiaries aged 65+ years between January 2012 and December 2014. We then reconstructed the full sample using inverse probability sampling weights. We developed prediction models using longitudinal Medicare data, then in a separate sample evaluated the predictive performance of each model, for example, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), sensitivity, and specificity. Results: Of 20,945 patients in the reconstructed sample, 2.1{\%} had confirmed epilepsy. The best-performing prediction model to identify prevalent epilepsy required epilepsy diagnoses with multiple claims at least 60 days apart, and epilepsy-specific drug claims: AUROC=0.93 [95{\%} confidence interval (CI), 0.90-0.96], and with an 80{\%} diagnostic threshold, sensitivity=87.8{\%} (95{\%} CI, 80.4{\%}-93.2{\%}), specificity=98.4{\%} (95{\%} CI, 98.2{\%}-98.5{\%}). A similar model also performed well in predicting incident epilepsy (k=0.79; 95{\%} CI, 0.66-0.92). Conclusions: Prediction models using longitudinal Medicare data perform well in predicting incident and prevalent epilepsy status accurately.},

@article{Charnigo2010,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Greater epidemiologic understanding of the relationships among fetal-infant mortality and its prognostic factors, including birthweight, could have vast public health implications. A key step toward that understanding is a realistic and tractable framework for analyzing birthweight distributions and fetal-infant mortality. The present paper is the first of a two-part series that introduces such a framework. METHODS: We propose describing a birthweight distribution via a normal mixture model in which the number of components is determined from the data using a model selection criterion rather than fixed a priori. RESULTS: We address a number of methodological issues, including how the number of components selected depends on the sample size, how the choice of model selection criterion influences the results, and how estimates of mixture model parameters based on multiple samples from the same population can be combined to produce confidence intervals. As an illustration, we find that a 4-component normal mixture model reasonably describes the birthweight distribution for a population of white singleton infants born to heavily smoking mothers. We also compare this 4-component normal mixture model to two competitors from the existing literature: a contaminated normal model and a 2-component normal mixture model. In a second illustration, we discover that a 6-component normal mixture model may be more appropriate than a 4-component normal mixture model for a general population of black singletons. CONCLUSIONS: The framework developed in this paper avoids assuming the existence of an interval of birthweights over which there are no compromised pregnancies and does not constrain birthweights within compromised pregnancies to be normally distributed. Thus, the present framework can reveal heterogeneity in birthweight that is undetectable via a contaminated normal model or a 2-component normal mixture model.},

"However, the goal is not to find good fitting models for their own sake. Rather, such models may lead to better assessments of mortality."

abstract = {Social epidemiologists often seek to determine the mechanisms that underlie health disparities. This work is typically based on mediation procedures that may not be justified with exposures of common interest in social epidemiology. In this analysis, we explored the consequences of using standard approaches, referred to as the difference and generalized product methods, when mediator-outcome confounders are associated with the exposure. We compared these with inverse probability-weighted marginal structural models, the structural transformation method, doubly robust g-estimation of a structural nested model, and doubly robust targeted minimum loss-based estimation. We used data on 900,726 births from 2003 to 2007 in the Penn Moms study, conducted in Pennsylvania, to assess the extent to which breastfeeding prior to hospital discharge explained the racial disparity in infant mortality. Overall, for every 1,000 births, 3.36 more infant deaths occurred among non-Hispanic black women relative to all other women (95{\%} confidence interval: 2.78, 3.93). Using the difference and generalized product methods to assess the disparity that would remain if everyone breastfed prior to discharge suggested a complete elimination of the disparity (risk difference = -0.87 per 1,000 births; 95{\%} confidence interval: -1.39, -0.35). In contrast, doubly robust methods suggested a reduction in the disparity to 2.45 (95{\%} confidence interval: 2.20, 2.71) more infant deaths per 1,000 births among non-Hispanic black women. Standard approaches for mediation analysis in health disparities research can yield misleading results.},

abstract = {We used classical and extended adoption designs in Swedish registries to disentangle genetic and rearing-environment influences on the intergenerational transmission of divorce. In classical adoption analyses, adoptees (n = 19,715) resembled their biological parents, rather than their adoptive parents, in their history of divorce. In extended adoption analyses, offspring (n = 82,698) resembled their not-lived-with fathers and their lived-with mothers. There was stronger resemblance to lived-with mothers, providing indirect evidence of rearing-environment influences on the intergenerational transmission of divorce. The heritability of divorce assessed across generations was 0.13. We attempted to replicate our findings using within-generation data from adoptive and biological siblings (ns = 8,523–53,097). Adoptees resembled their biological, not adoptive, siblings in their history of divorce. Thus, there was consistent evidence that genetic factors contributed to the intergenerational transmission of divorce but weaker evidence for a rearing-environment effect of divorce. Within-generation data from siblings supported these conclusions.},

There was an increased incidence  of intellectual delay at 3 and 5 years of age.

@article{Goodman1993,
abstract = {It is not generally appreciated that the p value, as conceived by R. A. Fisher, is not compatible with the Neyman-Pearson hypothesis test in which it has become embedded. The p value was meant to be a flexible inferential measure, whereas the hypothesis test was a rule for behavior, not inference. The combination of the two methods has led to a reinterpretation of the p value simultaneously as an “observed error rate” and as a measure of evidence. Both of these interpretations are problematic, and their combination has obscured the important differences between Neyman and Fisher on the nature of the scientific method and inhibited our understanding of the philosophic implications of the basic methods in use today. An analysis using another method promoted by Fisher, mathematical likelihood, shows that the p value substantially overstates the evidence against the null hypothesis. Likelihood makes clearer the distinction between error rates and inferential evidence and is a quantitative tool for expressing evidential strength that is more appropriate for the purposes of epidemiology than the p value.},

abstract = {Objective: There have been no validated Medicare claims-based algorithms available to identify epilepsy by discrete etiology of stroke (e.g., post-stroke epilepsy, PSE) in community-dwelling elderly individuals, despite the increasing availability of large datasets. Our objective was to validate algorithms that detect which patients have true PSE. Methods: We linked electronic health records (EHR) to Medicare claims from a Medicare Pioneer Accountable Care Organization (ACO) to identify PSE. A neurologist reviewed 01/2012-12/2014 EHR data from a stratified sample of Medicare patients aged 65+ years to adjudicate a reference-standard to develop an algorithm for identifying patients with PSE. Patient sampling strata included those with: A) epilepsy-related claims diagnosis (n = 534 [all]); B) no diagnosis but neurologist visit (n = 500 [randomly sampled from 4346]); C) all others (n = 500 [randomly sampled from 16,065]). We reconstructed the full sample using inverse probability sampling weights; then used half to derive algorithms and assess performance, and the remainder to confirm performance. We evaluated predictive performance across several measures, e.g., specificity, sensitivity, negative and positive predictive values (NPV, PPV). We selected our best performing algorithms based on the greatest specificity and sensitivity. Results: Of 20,943 patients in the reconstructed sample, 13.6{\%} of patients with epilepsy had reference-standard PSE diagnosis, which represents a 3-year overall prevalence of 0.28{\%} or 28/10,000, and a prevalence within the subpopulation with stroke of 3{\%}. The best algorithm included three conditions: (a) at least one cerebrovascular claim AND one epilepsy-specific anticonvulsant OR (b) at least one cerebrovascular claim AND one electroencephalography claim (specificity 100.0{\%} [95{\%} CI 99.9{\%}–100.0{\%}], NPV 98.8{\%} [98.6{\%}–99.0{\%}], sensitivity 20.6{\%} [95{\%} CI 14.6{\%}–27.9{\%}], PPV 86.5{\%} [95{\%} CI 71.2{\%}–95.5{\%}]). Conclusion: Medicare claims can identify elderly Medicare beneficiaries with PSE with high accuracy. Future epidemiological surveillance of epilepsy could incorporate similar algorithms to accurately identify epilepsy by varying etiologies.},

abstract = {To present the prevalence and urban-rural differences of overweight and obesity in 7-9-year-old Swedish schoolchildren, we used anthropometric data from a nationally representative survey performed in 2008. Trained staff weighed and measured 4538 children in grades 1 and 2 in 94 primary schools. Weight classification was performed using the IOTF reference and school areas were classified based on level of urbanization and area-level education. Overweight was found in 17{\%} of the children including 3{\%} obese. For overweight, odds-ratios were 1.33 and 1.61 (significant) in semi-urban and rural areas, relative to urban areas. After adjusting for area-level education, differences by degree of urbanisation were greatly attenuated and non-significant. For obesity urban-rural differences were observed in boys only and remained after adjustment for area-level education. For area-level education, risk estimates were significantly elevated and unaffected by urbanization and gender, odds-ratios 1.75 and 2.21 for overweight and 2.62 and 3.69 for obesity, in medium- and low-education areas compared to high-education areas. This supports earlier reports identifying areas with low socioeconomic status as high-risk areas for overweight and obesity. However, this study also suggests that gender should be considered when targeting children in urban as well as rural communities for health promoting interventions.},

We used data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, a United Kingdom prospective cohort (1990 through the present) with a median of 10 maternal weight measurements in pregnancy. These were used to allocate participants to 2009 Institute of Medicine weight-gain categories and in random effect linear spline models. Outcomes were School Entry Assessment score (age, 4 years; n = 5,832), standardized intelligence quotient assessed by Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (age, 8 years; n = 5,191), and school final-examination results (age, 16 years; n = 7,339). Offspring of women who gained less weight than recommended had a 0.075 standard deviation lower mean School Entry Assessment score (95{\%} confidence interval: -0.127, -0.023) and were less likely to achieve adequate final-examination results (odds ratio = 0.88, 95{\%} confidence interval: 0.78, 0.99) compared with offspring of women who gained as recommended. GWG in early pregnancy (defined as 0-18 weeks on the basis of a knot point at 18 weeks) and midpregnancy (defined as 18-28 weeks on the basis of knot points at 18 and 28 weeks) was positively associated with School Entry Assessment score and intelligence quotient. GWG in late pregnancy (defined as 28 weeks onward on the basis of a knot point at 28 weeks) was positively associated with offspring intelligence quotient and with increased odds of offspring achieving adequate final-examination results in mothers who were overweight prepregnancy. Findings support small positive associations between GWG and offspring cognitive development, which may have lasting effects on educational attainment up to age 16 years.},

We did not find clear evidence that GWG in the first 18 weeks of pregnancy, when the contribution of maternal fat deposition may not be the main driver of associations. In our study, birth weight partially mediated associations of GWG with offspring cognitive outcomes, suggesting that fetal growth is not the main driver of associations."

"Our findings may reflect the association of fetal growth with childhood cognition. Alternatively, the observed association of birth weight with IQ and, here of GWG with cognitive outcomes coudl be attributable to residual confounding and not reflections of a direct intrauterine effect."

Development of statistical methods to address missingness have been actively pursued in recent years, including imputation, likelihood and weighting approaches. Each approach is more complicated when there are many patterns of missing values, or when both categorical and continuous random variables are involved. Implementations of routines to incorporate observations with incomplete variables in regression models are now widely available. We review these routines in the context of a motivating example from a large health services research dataset. While there are still limitations to the current implementations, and additional efforts are required of the analyst, it is feasible to incorporate partially observed values, and these methods should be utilized in practice.},

The sample came from Wave 1 of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. The mean age was 16 years. According to their interviewers, the mixed race children had an African American physical appearance. The African American adolescents had a lower birth weight, a lower verbal IQ, and a higher number of sexual partners than did White adolescents. For each characteristic, the mixed race mean fell between the means of the two parental populations. Design extensions were proposed that include: (1) directly genotyping for individual racial admixture, (2) including parents of the mixed race children, and (3) including their cousins.},

abstract = {Malaria is one of the most common and preventable causes of adverse birth outcomes. In Africa, important progress has been made in the past decade with the introduction of a preventive strategy for malaria in pregnancy consisting of intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp) and insecticide-treated nets, yet their coverage is still unacceptably low and malaria continues to demand a huge toll on pregnant women and their newborn babies. Increasing the frequency of dosing of IPTp with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine might provide temporary respite, but increasing resistance to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine makes research into safe, efficacious, and affordable alternatives for IPTp one of the  highest priorities for the control of malaria in pregnancy. A number of promising alternatives are, or will soon be, available that need to be evaluated as IPTp after their safety and pharmacokinetics in pregnancy have first been assessed in  parasitaemic women. Little is known about appropriate control strategies in Asia  and Latin America for Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax malaria in pregnancy, which in most countries rely on responsive case management approaches. The role of case management based on proactive screening for malaria infection of women attending antenatal care or preventive approaches with insecticide-treated  nets or IPTp are urgently needed. To achieve these objectives, multicentre and multidisciplinary approaches are required across the range of malaria transmission settings that include assessment of immunological effect of successful preventions, the perceptions and acceptability of different preventive approaches, and their cost-effectiveness.},

abstract = {Regression discontinuity analyses can generate estimates of the causal effects of an exposure when a continuously measured variable is used to assign the exposure to individuals based on a threshold rule. Individuals just above the threshold are expected to be similar in their distribution of measured and unmeasured baseline covariates to individuals just below the threshold, resulting in exchangeability. At the threshold exchangeability is guaranteed if there is random variation in the continuous assignment variable, e.g., due to random measurement error. Under exchangeability, causal effects can be identified at the threshold. The regression discontinuity intention-to-treat (RD-ITT) effect on an outcome can be estimated as the difference in the outcome between individuals just above (or below) versus just below (or above) the threshold. This effect is analogous to the ITT effect in a randomized controlled trial. Instrumental variable methods can be used to estimate the effect of exposure itself utilizing the threshold as the instrument. We review the recent epidemiologic literature reporting regression discontinuity studies and find that while regression discontinuity designs are beginning to be utilized in a variety of applications in epidemiology, they are still relatively rare, and analytic and reporting practices vary. Regression discontinuity has the potential to greatly contribute to the evidence base in epidemiology, in particular on the real-life and long-term effects and side-effects of medical treatments that are provided based on threshold rules - such as treatments for low birth weight, hypertension or diabetes.},

@article{Higano2014a,
abstract = {Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) has been the standard of care for metastatic prostate cancer for decades; however, the choice of continuous or intermittent administration is a matter of debate. Two large phase III trials have reported results comparing these 2 forms of ADT administration. The National Cancer Institute of Canada (NCIC) PR-7 trial studied men with an increasing prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level and no evidence of metastatic disease after definitive or salvage radiation therapy and radical prostatectomy. The Southwest Oncology Group 9346 trial studied men with newly diagnosed hormone-sensitive metastatic disease. The primary end point in both trials was overall survival with a noninferiority design. The NCIC trial showed that the overall survival in men treated with intermittent ADT was not inferior to that of men treated with continuous ADT, but the SWOG trial was inconclusive regarding noninferiority. Certain domains of quality of life were better in the intermittent arms of both trials. If using ADT in the setting of biochemical relapse, intermittent ADT should be strongly considered over continuous ADT, except perhaps in patients with Gleason score of 8 or higher. In men with metastatic disease, continuous ADT remains the standard of care, because the SWOG trial did not establish noninferiority of intermittent ADT with respect to survival. However, for those with significant side effects from ADT, establishing the risk group, as determined by PSA value after 7 months of ADT or the presence of pain at diagnosis, may help guide the choice of intermittent versus continuous ADT in men with metastatic disease. {\textcopyright} JNCCN - Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network.},

Study 1 assessed reactivity to parental conflict simulations among 56 school-age children, whereas Study 2 solicited child and mother reports of 170 young adolescents' reactions to actual marital conflict. Cluster analyses in both studies indicated that children fit three profiles: (1) secure children, who showed well-regulated concern and positive representations of interparental relationships; (2) insecure-preoccupied children, who evidenced heightened distress, involvement or avoidance, and negative representations of interparental relationships; and (3) insecure-dismissing children, who displayed overt signs of elevated distress, avoidance, and involvement and low levels of subjective distress, avoidance and intervention impulses, and negative internal representations. Results in both studies indicated that preoccupied and dismissing children experienced more interparental conflict than did secure children, and preoccupied children evidenced the highest levels of internalizing symptoms. Study 2 results indicated that dismissing children had the highest levels of externalizing symptoms and preoccupied and dismissing children reported more coping, family, and personality difficulties than did secure children.},

abstract = {Even in the absence of unmeasured confounding factors or model misspecification, standard methods for estimating the causal effect of time-varying treatments on survival are biased when (a) there exists a time-dependent risk factor for survival that also predicts subsequent treatment, and (b) past treatment history predicts subsequent risk factor level. In contrast, methods based on marginal structural models (MSMs) can provide consistent estimates of causal effects when unmeasured confounding and model misspecification are absent. MSMs are a new class of causal models whose parameters are estimated using a new class of estimators-inverse-probability-of-treatment weighted estimators. We use a marginal structural Cox proportional hazards model to estimate the joint effect of zidovudine (AZT) and prophylaxis therapy for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia on the survival of HIV-positive men in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study, an observational study of homosexual men. We obtained an estimated causal mortality rate (hazard) ratio of .67 (conservative 95{\%} confidence interval .46-.98) for AZT and of 1.14 (.79, 1.64) for prophylaxis therapy. These estimates will be consistent for the true causal rate ratios when the functional forms chosen for our models are correct and data have been obtained on all time-independent and time-dependent covariates that predict both subsequent treatment and mortality.},

abstract = {The management of chronic conditions is characterized by frequent re-assessment of therapy decisions in response to the patient's changing condition over the course of the illness. Evidence most suitable to inform care thus often concerns the contrast of adaptive treatment strategies that repeatedly personalize treatment decisions over time using the latest accumulated data available from the patient's previous clinic visits such as laboratory exams (e.g., hemoglobin A1c measurements in diabetes care). The frequency at which such information is monitored implicitly defines the causal estimand that is typically evaluated in an observational or randomized study of such adaptive treatment strategies. Analytic control of monitoring with standard estimation approaches for time-varying interventions can therefore not only improve study generalizibility but also inform the optimal timing of clinical surveillance. Valid inference with these estimators requires the upholding of a positivity assumption that can hinder their applicability. To potentially weaken this requirement for monitoring control, we introduce identifiability results that will facilitate the derivation of alternate estimators of effects defined by general joint treatment and monitoring interventions in the context of time-to-event outcomes. These results are developed based on the nonparametric structural equation modeling framework using a no direct effect assumption originally introduced in a prior paper that inspired this work. The relevance and scope of the results presented here are illustrated with examples in diabetes comparative effectiveness research.},

Real world evidence based on data collected outside of RCTs, such as registries and longitudinal healthcare databases, can sometimes substitute for RCTs, but concerns about validity have limited their impact. Greater reliance on such real world data (RWD) in regulatory decision making requires understanding why some studies fail while others succeed in producing results similar to RCTs. Key questions when considering whether RWD analyses can substitute for RCTs for regulatory decision making are WHEN one can study drug effects without randomization and HOW to implement a valid RWD analysis if one has decided to pursue that option. The WHEN is primarily driven by externalities not controlled by investigators, whereas the HOW is focused on avoiding known mistakes in RWD analyses.},

Methods: In this retrospective study, perinatal, neonatal, and cranial scan data of 85 monochorionic (MC) and 94 dichorionic (DC) twin pregnancies (341 infants) delivered between 24 and 34 weeks of gestation were collected. Data were analysed according to chorionicity, discordant birth weight ({\textgreater}20{\%}), single intrauterine death and TTTS. Results: The cerebral WML was seen in 14{\%} of preterm twins. Monochorionic infants had higher risks of WML than DC twin (odds ratio 7.1; 95{\%} CI 3.28-15.8). In MC group, discordant weight (37{\%}), TTTS (38{\%}), single intrauterine death (67{\%}) had higher incidence of cerebral WML than concordant weight infants (7{\%}). Similarly, incidence of WML was higher in DC discordant compared with concordant weight infants (13{\%} versus 2{\%}; P {\textless} 0.05). Conclusion: Monochorionic infants had a seven-fold higher incidence of cerebral WML than DC infants.

Moreover, the analytic approaches most frequently employed in the epidemiologic literature to minimize selection bias are difficult to implement appropriately in racial disparities research. This difficulty stems from the fact that frequently employed analytic techniques require that common causes of survival and the outcome are accurately measured. Unfortunately, such common causes are often unmeasured or poorly measured in racial health disparities studies. In the absence of accurate measures of the aforementioned common causes, redefining the target population or changing the study design represents a useful approach for reducing the extent of survival-related selection bias. To help researchers recognize and minimize survival-related selection bias in racial health disparities studies, we illustrate the aforementioned selection bias and how redefining the target population or changing the study design can be useful.},

abstract = {The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), a ligand-activated transcription factor that belongs to the basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH)-Per-ARNT-Sim (PAS) superfamily of transcription factors, mediates toxic response induced by environmental chemicals such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). AhR is expressed at high levels in several human breast carcinoma cell lines in direct correlation with the degree of their malignancy. Recent studies suggest a possible role for AhR in cancer independent of PAH. Therefore, we established stable AhR knockdown cells of the human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 and analyzed their tumorigenic properties in in vitro and in vivo model systems. In addition we analyzed their response to radiation and chemotherapeutic treatment. AhR knockdown attenuated these cells tumorigenic properties in vitro including proliferation, anchorage independent growth, migration and apoptosis and reduced orthotopic xenograft tumor growth and lung metastasis in vivo. Notably, we observed that AhR knockdown enhanced radiation-induced apoptosis as well as significantly decreased cell clonogenic survival. Furthermore, AhR knockdown in MDA-MB-231 cells sensitized them to paclitaxel treatment, evident by a decrease in the required cytotoxic dose. Subsequent analysis revealed AhR knockdown significantly reduced phosphorylation of AKT, which impacts cell proliferation and survival. Apoptosis-focused gene expression analyses revealed an altered expression of genes regulating apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells. Collectively, our data identify AhR as a potential novel therapeutic target in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer.},

Economists have analyzed the negative effects that low birth weight might have on subsequent school outcomes, while taking into account unobserved characteristics that may be common to families with low birth weight babies and negative outcomes in terms of school test scores when children, in addition to labor market income when adults. Today, however, with increasing obesity rates in the United States, high birth weight has become a potential concern, and has been associated in the medical literature with an increased likelihood of becoming an overweight child, adolescent, and subsequently an obese adult. Overweight and obesity, in turn, are associated with a host of negative effects, including lower test scores in school and lower labor market prospects when adults. If studies only focus on low birth weight, they may underestimate the effects of ensuring that mothers receive adequate support during pregnancy. In this study we find that cognitive outcomes are adversely affected not only by low birth weight ({\textless}2500 grams) but also by high birth weight ({\textgreater}4500 grams). Our results have policy implications in terms of provision of support for pregnant women.},

Abstract: Fifty-six mothers and their 24-month-old toddlers were observed on two occasions in a series of laboratory procedures designed to assess relations between emotional functioning (emotional reactivity and emotion regulation) in an individual assessment and social behavior with a same-sex peer. Emotional reactivity was assessed using two frustration tasks designed to elicit distress. Emotional regulation was assessed by examining the child's behaviors (venting, distraction, focal-object focus, self-orientation, and mother-orientation) when confronted by the two distress-eliciting tasks. Peer play behaviors were coded for social participation and peer-directed conflict (aggressive) behavior. The results indicated that both emotional reactivity and emotion regulation were important predictors of at least two types of social behavior: conflict and cooperation. Distress to frustration, when accompanied by high venting or high focal-object focus, was significantly related to conflict with peers but not when accompanied by distraction, mother-orientation or self-focused behaviors. These findings are discussed in terms of the adaptive value of emotion regulation skills in early development, and the importance of identifying the causal relations between child regulation and early social competence.},

abstract = {Purpose of Review Pharmacoepidemiologists are often interested in estimating the effects of dynamic treatment strategies, where treatments are modified based on patients' evolving characteristics. For such problems, appropriate control of both baseline and time-varying confounders is critical. Conventional methods that control confounding by including time-varying treatments and confounders in an outcome regression model may not have a causal interpretation, even when all baseline and time-varying confounders are measured. This problem occurs when time-varying confounders are, themselves, affected by past treatment. We review alternative analytic approaches that can produce valid inferences in the presence of such confounding. We focus on the parametric g-formula and inverse probability weighting of marginal structural models, two examples of Robins' g-methods. Recent Findings Unlike standard outcome regression methods, the parametric g-formula and inverse probability weighting of marginal structural models can estimate the effects of dynamic treatment strategies and appropriately control for measured time-varying confounders affected by prior treatment. Few applications of g-methods exist in the pharmacoepidemiology literature, primarily due to the common use of administrative claims data, which typically lack detailed measurements of time-varying information, and the limited availability of or familiarity with tools to help perform the relatively complex analysis. These barriers may be overcome with the increasing availability of data sources containing more detailed time-varying information and more accessible learning tools and software. Summary With appropriate data and study design, g-methods can improve our ability to make causal inferences on dynamic treatment strategies from observational data in pharma coepidemiology.},

Methods and Materials: The original systematic review yielded 294 studies published between January 1990 and December 2012. In April 2018, the guideline underwent an amendment and incorporated 155 references that were published between January 1990 and December 2017. Two new key questions were added: one on the use of genomic classifiers and the other on the treatment of oligo-metastases with radiation after radical prostatectomy. Results: A new statement on the use of hormone therapy with salvage radiation therapy (RT) after radical prostatectomy was added, and long-term data were used to update an existing statement on adjuvant RT. The balance of the guideline statements were reaffirmed, and references added to the existing literature base. A discussion on the use of genomic classifiers as a risk stratification tool was added to the future research discussion. No relevant data on oligo-metastases were found. Conclusions: Hormone therapy should be offered to patients who have had radical prostatectomy and who are candidates for salvage RT. Clinicians should discuss possible short- and long-term side effects with patients in addition to the potential benefits of preventing recurrence. The decision to use hormone therapy should be made by the patient and a multidisciplinary team of providers with full consideration of the patient's history, values, preferences, quality of life, and functional status.},

abstract = {Young, Hern{\'{a}}n, and Robins consider the mean outcome under a dynamic intervention that may rely on the natural value of treatment. They first identify this value with a statistical target parameter, and then show that this statistical target parameter can also be identified with a causal parameter which gives the mean outcome under a stochastic intervention. The authors then describe estimation strategies for these quantities. Here we augment the authors' insightful discussion by sharing our experiences in situations where two causal questions lead to the same statistical estimand, or the newer problem that arises in the study of data adaptive parameters, where two statistical estimands can lead to the same estimation problem. Given a statistical estimation problem, we encourage others to always use a robust estimation framework where the data generating distribution truly belongs to the statistical model. We close with a discussion of a framework which has these properties.},

abstract = {Examines several fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and fetal alcohol effects prevention efforts in the US, focusing on alcoholic beverage warning labels and community-based efforts, such as prenatal clinic programs. An ongoing study of the effect of the label warning on 3,572 pregnant African-American women in Detroit is described. Findings suggest a small decrease in drinking and a sense of personal invulnerability to FAS by women who have already had babies. Prenatal clinic programs in Boston and Detroit that use counseling and intensive education are described as well. The effectiveness of health care and teacher training and community project in King County, WA, and a community-based program in Tuba City, AZ are outlined. It is concluded that the label has resulted in a modest effect on drinking by pregnant women, while community-based efforts are much more effective, although they reach a much smaller audience.

annote = {"Because abstaining from alcohol prior to and throughout pregnancy is the only way to guarantee the birth of a child free of FAS/FAE, prevention programs try to target women before they become pregnant. However, the programs also should target women who are drinking during pregnancy, to increase their likelihood of having healthy babies in the current as well as subsequent pregnancies."


"As 80 percent of the pregnancies in the study population are unplanned and the women do not begin prenatal care until the second semester, the warning label reaches them before health care providers do."

found awareness of the label increased after warning label law

"women who are older and have had multiple children tend to drink more than younger women who have not had children"

"women who needed the warning the most, those drinking at risk levels, did not change the amount of alcohol they consumed after the warning label was implemented."

"One explanation is that 71{\%} of the risk drinkers had been pregnant before. Although we were blinded to the outcome of the women's births, we hypothesize that the women believe (rightly or wrongly) that their babies are healthy). Women in the study were asked how often it was safe to drink while pregnant and how likely it was that their baby would be healthy if they drank alcohol at risk levels. Responses suggest that pregnant women who previously gave birth to babies are more likely to feel safe drinking daily and to believe their future babies will be healthy if they drink heavily during pregnancy than do women who never gave birth."

increase education among medical providers successful in terms of them asking patients about alcohol consumption

boston program increase self-esteem, promote abstinence, refer to treatment and community agencies successful in reducing drinking by third trimester

awareness among pregnant women about the risks of alcohol during pregnancy successful

among Navajo/Hopi: "The project operates prevention programs that involve communitywide FAS education, prenatal clinic screening for alcohol use, and education for women in prenatal clinics. For women identified as high risk because they drink heavily during their pregnancies and previously gave birth to a child with FAS or FAE, the prevention program includes detoxification, individual and group therapy, and voluntary birth control or sterilization services."},

The approach identifies both a method of testing for selection effects and for consistent estimation if selection effects are shown to be statistically significant. The approach is illustrated with a meta regression of wetland ecosystem values. The application shows that selection is statistically and economically significant. Selection effects lead to baseline wetland values that are almost 4 times larger than values computed using the selection corrected parameters. Value adjustment factors for wetland services and methodological variables appear less prone to selection effects. The uncorrected value adjustment factors for wetland services and research methods are, on average, within 15{\%} of the selection corrected value adjustment factors. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Simulation studies are computer experiments that involve creating data by pseudorandom sampling. The key strength of simulation studies is the ability to understand the behaviour of statistical methods because some 'truth' (usually some parameter/s of interest) is known from the process of generating the data. This allows us to consider properties of methods, such as bias. While widely used, simulation studies are often poorly designed, analysed and reported. This tutorial outlines the rationale for using simulation studies and offers guidance for design, execution, analysis, reporting and presentation. In particular, this tutorial provides: a structured approach for planning and reporting simulation studies, which involves defining aims, data-generating mechanisms, estimands, methods and performance measures ('ADEMP'); coherent terminology for simulation studies; guidance on coding simulation studies; a critical discussion of key performance measures and their estimation; guidance on structuring tabular and graphical presentation of results; and new graphical presentations. With a view to describing recent practice, we review 100 articles taken from Volume 34 of Statistics in Medicine that included at least one simulation study and identify areas for improvement.},

Effect modification can be present with no interaction; interaction can be present with no effect modification. There are settings in which it is possible to assess effect modification but not interaction, or to assess interaction but not effect modification. The analytic procedures for obtaining estimates of effect modification parameters and interaction parameters using marginal structural models are compared and contrasted.

@article{Schuetz2008,
abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Preclinical animal studies have established stressors, substance use associated cues, and priming as distinct triggers of relapse in substance dependence. These triggers seem to induce relapse by activating distinct brain pathways. In order to test these findings in humans, it is necessary to establish new human research paradigms. Neuroimaging may help to study brain regions involved in mediating the effects of these distinct triggers of relapse and to further delineate mediators of these pathways. In order to understand individual differences it is crucial to assess the impact of moderators on these pathways to relapse. METHODS: Paradigms to study distinct relapse triggers are currently being set up for tobacco dependence. It is practically impossible to study human relapse and specifically its neurobiological pathways in the natural surrounding. Instead we aim to establish vulnerability patterns in a laboratory environment, applying functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) assessments during trigger exposure. Brain activation determined by fMRI may constitute a sensitive measure to assess responses to cues, stress, and priming. Establishing these paradigms will then allow to further delineate the role of possible mediators (e.g. attention, inhibition) and moderators (e.g. sex, genetic factors) underlying relapse to smoking. RESULTS: Initial results are encouraging, but this approach needs further studies to proof its usefulness. CONCLUSIONS: We outline an approach to study nicotine relapse within a laboratory environment, using fMRI assessments during trigger exposure. The long term goal is rational treatment development. To reach this goal it is crucial to identify, include and investigate critical moderators and mediators of relapse within this approach.},

abstract = {Purpose: Among patients with biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy, we found previously that postoperative prostate-specific antigen doubling time (PSADT) was associated with risk of prostate cancer death. However, given the small number of patients in the highest risk PSADT subgroup, it is unclear which PSADT subgroups contribute the greatest to prostate cancer-specific death and how this influences all-cause mortality. Patients and Methods: This study was a retrospective analysis of 379 patients treated with radical prostatectomy between 1982 and 2000 who had a biochemical recurrence and PSADT data available. Mean and median follow-up after surgery was 11.4 (standard deviation, 5.4) and 11.0 years, respectively (range, 1.6 to 23.0 years). Results: Shorter PSADT was significantly associated with prostate cancer-specific and all-cause mortality (P {\textless} .001). Although patients with a PSADT less than 3 months were at the greatest risk of death, because of the limited number of patients in this group, they accounted for only 13{\%} of prostate cancer deaths at 15 years after biochemical recurrence, whereas patients with an intermediate PSADT (3.0 to 8.9 months) accounted for 58{\%} of all prostate cancer deaths. Among patients with a PSADT less than 15 months, prostate cancer accounted for 90{\%} of all deaths. Only patients in the slowest PSADT subgroup (≥ 15 months) had a greater risk of competing-causes mortality compared with that from prostate cancer. Conclusion: Among a select cohort of young, healthy patients with PSA recurrence after radical prostatectomy and a PSADT less than 15 months, prostate cancer accounted for an estimated 90{\%} of all deaths by 15 years after recurrence. The majority of prostate cancer deaths occurred among patients with an intermediate PSADT (3.0 to 8.9 months). {\textcopyright} 2007 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.},

To assess whether cytochrome P450 (CYP) gene polymorphisms modulate the effect of dioxins and/or PCBs in endometriosis risk, we conducted a case-control study among infertile Japanese women. A total of 138 eligible women aged 20-45 were diagnosed laparoscopically and classified into three subgroups: control (no endometriosis), early endometriosis (stages I-II) and advanced endometriosis (stages III-IV). Neither CYP1A1 Ile462Val and CYP1B1 Leu432Val polymorphisms (genotypes with versus genotypes without the minor allele) nor serum dioxin and PCB toxic equivalency (TEQ) levels (low versus high) were independently associated with either early or advanced endometriosis risk. However, genotypes with the CYP1A1 462Val allele showed a statistically significant reduced risk of advanced endometriosis in combination with high serum dioxin TEQ levels (adjusted odds ratio = 0.13, 95{\%} confidence interval: 0.02-0.76) (P for interaction = 0.08). Although no association was found between serum PCB TEQ level and advanced endometriosis in any stratum of CYP1B1 Leu432Val polymorphism, a statistically significant interaction was found (P for interaction = 0.05). CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 polymorphisms may modify the relation between environmental exposure to organochlorine and advanced endometriosis risk.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany. Aim: Community-based participatory research (CBPR) is an increasingly common approach in the USA, but still relatively rare in Europe. In the industrial zone of Marseille, there is a long history of pollution, but little is known about the health implications. This study documented the prevalence of different health issues in two heavily polluted towns in the industrial zone using a CBPR approach. Subject and methods: This study used a CBPR approach and epidemiologic methods to answer community members' questions about the health of residents in Marseille's industrial zone by randomly sampling a cross-section of residents to systematically document health issues in Fos-sur-Mer and Port-Saint-Louis-du-Rh{\^{o}}ne, two towns in the industrial port area of Marseille, France. Results: Many chronic illnesses were elevated in these communities, as compared to regional and national prevalences, including chronic skin problems, asthma, cancer, and diabetes. Chronic skin problems and asthma were among the most common chronic illnesses reported. A majority of respondents also reported acute symptoms that affected daily life, including eye irritation or nose and throat problems. Conclusion: There is likely an environmental explanation for why, even after direct standardization, the prevalences of many diseases were higher in these communities than elsewhere. The combination of CBPR and rigorous epidemiologic methods helps make our findings relevant to both community members and researchers.},

Thus, bias due to misclasstflcation cannot be adequately dealt with by the methods used for control of confounding. The examples presented also show that the “change-in-estimate” criterion for deciding whether to control a covariate can be systematically misleading when mis-classification is present These results demonstrate that it is necessary to consider the degree of misdassiflcation when deciding whether to control a covariate.},

abstract = {Endometriosis is a common gynecologic problem of unknown etiology. Estrogen dependence and immune modulation are established features of this disease, and environmental contaminants have been suggested to play a role in the pathobiology of this disease as well. Previous work in nonhuman primates has shown that exposure to the dioxin 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) is associated with an increased prevalence and severity of endometriosis. Further animal experiments have implicated dioxin and dioxin-like compounds in this disease. Rodent studies support the plausibility of a role of environmental contaminants in the pathophysiology of endometriosis, although a convincing mechanistic hypothesis has yet to be advanced. Small hospital-based case-control studies have failed to provide compelling evidence for or against an association of environmental contaminants and endometriosis. Herein we review evidence that dioxin and dioxin-like compounds are potent modulators of immune and endocrine function critical to the pathobiology of endometriosis. Furthermore, perspectives on the potential mechanism(s) of dioxin and dioxin-like compound-induced toxicity in endometriosis, important knowledge needs, potential animal models for endometriosis studies, and considerations integral to future human case-control studies are discussed.},

abstract = {Background: Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) constitute a major public health problem affecting one in 68 children. There is little understanding of the causes of ASD despite its serious social impact. Air pollution contains many toxicants known to have adverse effects on the fetus. We conducted a population based case-control study in southwestern Pennsylvania to estimate the association between ASD and 2005 US EPA modeled NATA (National Air Toxics Assessment) levels for 30 neurotoxicants. Methods: A total of 217 ASD cases born between 2005 and 2009 were recruited from local ASD diagnostic and treatment centers. There were two different control groups: 1) interviewed controls (N∈=∈224) frequency matched by child's year of birth, sex and race with complete residential histories from prior to pregnancy through the child's second birthday, and 2) 5,007 controls generated from a random sample of birth certificates (BC controls) using residence at birth. We used logistic regression analysis comparing higher to first quartile of exposure to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95 {\%} confidence intervals (CI), adjusting for mother's age, education, race, smoking status, child's year of birth and sex. Results: Comparing fourth to first quartile exposures for all births, the adjusted OR for styrene was 2.04 (95 {\%} CI∈=∈1.17-3.58, p∈=∈0.013) for the interviewed case-control analysis and 1.61 (95 {\%} CI∈=∈1.08-2.40, p∈=∈0.018) for the BC analysis. In the BC comparison, chromium also exhibited an elevated OR of 1.60 (95 {\%} CI∈=∈1.08-2.38, p∈=∈0.020), which was similarly elevated in the interviewed analysis (OR∈=∈1.52, 95 {\%} CI∈=∈0.87-2.66). There were borderline significant ORs for the BC comparison for methylene chloride (OR∈=∈1.41, 95 {\%} CI∈=∈0.96-2.07, p∈=∈0.082) and PAHs (OR∈=∈1.44, 95 {\%} CI∈=∈0.98-2.11, p∈=∈0.064). Conclusions: Living in areas with higher levels of styrene and chromium during pregnancy was associated with increased risk of ASD, with borderline effects for PAHs and methylene chloride. These results are consistent with other studies. It is unclear, however, whether these chemicals are risk factors themselves or if they reflect the effect of a mixture of pollutants. Future work should include improved spatiotemporal estimates of exposure to air toxics, taking into account the dynamic movement of individuals during daily life.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Studies testing whether systemic inflammation might lie on the causal pathway between aberrant fetal and post-natal growth patterns and later cardiovascular disease have been inconclusive, possibly due to the use of single markers of unknown predictive value. We used repeated measures of a comprehensive set of inflammatory markers to investigate the relationship between early life measures and systemic inflammation in an African population.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Individuals born in three rural villages in The Gambia, and for whom early life measurements were recorded, were traced (n = 320). Fasting levels of eight inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, serum amyloid A, orosomucoid, fibrinogen, $\alpha$ 1-antichymotrypsin, sialic acid, interleukin-6 and neopterin) were measured, and potential confounding factors recorded. The association between early life measurements and systemic inflammation was assessed using regression analysis.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Levels of most markers were unrelated to early growth patterns. In analyses adjusted for age and sex, more rapid growth between birth and 3 months of age was associated with higher levels of fibrinogen, orosomucoid, and sialic acid. These relationships persisted after further adjustment for body mass index but after full adjustment only the association with fibrinogen remained.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: This study provides little evidence that size at birth or growth in early infancy determine levels of inflammatory markers in young Gambian adults.},

abstract = {To address earlier reports of excess cancer mortality associated with employment at a large transformer manufacturing plant, each plant operation was rated for seven exposures: Pyranol (a mixture of polychlorinated biphenyls and trichlorobenzene), trichloroethylene, benzene, mixed solvents, asbestos, synthetic resins, and machining fluids. Site-specific cancer deaths among active or retired employees were cases; controls were selected from deaths (primarily cardiovascular deaths) presumed to be unassociated with any of the study exposures. Using job records, we then computed person-years of exposure for each subject. All subjects were white males. The only unequivocal association was that of resin systems with lung cancer (odds ratio = 2.2 at 16.6 years of exposure, P = 0.001, in a multiple logistic regression including asbestos, age, year of death, and year of hire). Certain other odds ratios appeared larger, but no other association was so robust and remained as distinct after considering the multiplicity of comparisons. Study power was very limited for most associations, and several biases may have affected our results. Nevertheless, further investigation of synthetic resin systems of the type used in the study plant appears warranted.},

abstract = {Purpose: The aim of this systematic review was to examine and compare differences in the way medication exposures are classified in studies using linked administrative data to investigate outcomes following medication use during pregnancy. This was undertaken with a focus on studies investigating specific neonatal outcomes following prenatal exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Methods: We searched Medline and Embase to identify studies that used linked administrative data to investigate specific neonatal outcomes (congenital malformations, birth weight, gestational age) following prenatal exposure to SSRIs. Results: Key factors such as dose, duration and timing of exposure were inconsistently addressed in the studies identified. In addition, there was a great deal of variability in the way medication exposures were classified and how women who stop taking their medication before or during early pregnancy are handled in analyses. Furthermore, there are issues in assuming how and when women who receive a dispensing for a medication actually take it during pregnancy. This creates a great deal of uncertainty around medication exposure during pregnancy in studies using linked administrative data, potentially resulting in biased risk estimates. Conclusions: There is a need for greater focus on determining the most effective and accurate way of using linked administrative data to investigate outcomes following medication use during pregnancy in an effort to minimise potential biases. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2011.},

abstract = {In this paper, we consider the problem of fair statistical inference involving outcome variables. Examples include classification and regression problems, and estimating treatment effects in randomized trials or observational data. The issue of fairness arises in such problems where some covariates or treatments are "sensitive," in the sense of having potential of creating discrimination. In this paper, we argue that the presence of discrimination can be formalized in a sensible way as the presence of an effect of a sensitive covariate on the outcome along certain causal pathways, a view which generalizes (Pearl, 2009). A fair outcome model can then be learned by solving a constrained optimization problem. We discuss a number of complications that arise in classical statistical inference due to this view and provide workarounds based on recent work in causal and semi-parametric inference.},

abstract = {Purpose of review When leveraging observational data to estimate treatment effects, it is useful to explicitly specify the "target trial" the investigators aspire to emulate. One concern is whether a proposed analysis plan can address the realities of the differences between the available non-randomized observational study and the target trial. When large or unknown sources of unmeasured confounding are suspected, investigators might consider turning to instrumental variable (IV) methods. Of course, the interpretation and appropriateness of IV analyses need to be considered carefully. The purpose of this review is to summarize recent methodologic advancements in how epidemiologists weigh the validity of an IV analysis and to place these methodologic advancements in the context of the feasible target trial's protocol components. Recent findings There have been increased development and application of tools for sensitivity analyses, falsification strategies, and the identification of previously overlooked problems with IV analyses as applied in pharmacoepidemiology. Many of these recent insights can be seen as articulating restrictions on or tradeoffs between the types of target trials that can be validly emulated when using a classical IV analysis. Summary Putting classical IV methods in the context of target trials underscores the importance of recent methodologic developments and, more generally, when and how an IV analysis would be appropriate. We see that some tradeoffs in defining the target trials are unavoidable, that some tradeoffs may be offset or explored via sensitivity analyses, and that this serves as a framework for scientific discourse regarding IV and non-IV results emulating potentially different trials with different tradeoffs.},

abstract = {To examine the association between maternal prepregnancy obesity and cognitive test scores of children at early primary school age. A descriptive observational design was used. Study subjects consist of 3,412 US children aged 60-83 months from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 Mother and Child Survey. Cognitive test scores using the Peabody Individual Achievement Test reading recognition and mathematics tests were used as the outcomes of interest. Association with maternal prepregnancy obesity was examined using the ordinary least square regression controlling for intrauterine, family background, maternal and child factors. Children of obese women had 3 points (0.23 SD units) lower peabody individual achievement test (PIAT) reading recognition score (p = 0.007), and 2 points (0.16 SD units) lower PIAT mathematics scores (p {\textless} 0.0001), holding all other factors constant. As expected, cognitive test score was associated with stimulating home environment (reading: $\beta$ = 0.15, p {\textless} 0.0001, and math: $\beta$ = 0.15, p {\textless} 0.0001), household income (reading: $\beta$ = 0.03, p = 0.02 and math: $\beta$ = 0.04, p = 0.004), maternal education (reading: $\beta$ = 0.42, p = 0.0005, and math: $\beta$ = 0.32, p = 0.008), and maternal cognitive skills (reading: $\beta$ = 0.11, p {\textless} 0.0001, and math: $\beta$ = 0.09, p {\textless} 0.0001). There was a significant association between maternal prepregnancy obesity and child cognitive test scores that could not be explained by other intrauterine, family background, maternal, and child factors. Children who live in disadvantaged postnatal environments may be most affected by the effects of maternal prepregnancy obesity. Replications of the current study using different cohorts are warranted to confirm the association between maternal prepregnancy obesity and child cognitive test scores.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Randomized trials are considered the gold standard for making inferences about the causal effects of treatments. However, when protocol deviations occur, the baseline randomization of the trial is no longer sufficient to ensure unbiased estimation of the per-protocol effect: post-randomization, time-varying confounders must be sufficiently measured and adjusted for in the analysis. Given the historical emphasis on intention-to-treat effects in randomized trials, measurement of post-randomization confounders is typically infrequent. This may induce bias in estimates of the per-protocol effect, even using methods such as inverse probability weighting, which appropriately account for time-varying confounders affected by past treatment. METHODS/DESIGN In order to concretely illustrate the potential magnitude of bias due to infrequent measurement of time-varying covariates, we simulated data from a very large trial with a survival outcome and time-varying confounding affected by past treatment. We generated the data such that the true underlying per-protocol effect is null and under varying degrees of confounding (strong, moderate, weak). In the simulated data, we estimated per-protocol survival curves and associated contrasts using inverse probability weighting under monthly measurement of the time-varying covariates (which constituted complete measurement in our simulation), yearly measurement, as well as 3- and 6-month intervals. RESULTS Using inverse probability weighting, we were able to recover the true null under the complete measurement scenario no matter the strength of confounding. Under yearly measurement intervals, the estimate of the per-protocol effect diverged from the null; inverse probability weighted estimates of the per-protocol 5-year risk ratio based on yearly measurement were 1.19, 1.12, and 1.03 under strong, moderate, and weak confounding, respectively. Bias decreased with measurement interval length. Under all scenarios, inverse probability weighted estimators were considerably less biased than a naive estimator that ignored time-varying confounding completely. CONCLUSIONS Bias that arises from interval measurement designs highlights the need for planning in the design of randomized trials for collection of time-varying covariate data. This may come from more frequent in-person measurement or external sources (e.g., electronic medical record data). Such planning will provide improved estimates of the per-protocol effect through the use of methods that appropriately adjust for time-varying confounders.},

abstract = {Agriculture can be an important engine of growth and poverty reduction. But the sector is underperforming in many countries in part because women, who are often a crucial resource in agriculture and the rural economy, face constraints that reduce their productivity. In this paper we draw on the available empirical evidence to study in which areas and to what degree women participate in agriculture. Aggregate data shows that women comprise about 43 percent of the agricultural labour force globally and in developing countries. But this figure masks considerable variation across regions and within countries according to age and social class. Time use surveys, which are more comprehensive but typically not nationally representative, add further insight into the substantial heterogeneity among countries and within countries in women's contribution to agriculture. They show that female time-use in agriculture varies also by crop, production cycle, age and ethnic group. A few time-use surveys have data by activity and these show that in general weeding and harvesting were predominantly female activities. Overall the labour burden of rural women exceeds that of men, and includes a higher proportion of unpaid household responsibilities related to preparing food and collecting fuel and water. The contribution of women to agricultural and food production is significant but it is impossible to verify empirically the share produced by women. Women's participation in rural labour markets varies considerably across regions, but invariably women are over represented in unpaid, seasonal and part-time work, and the available evidence suggests that women are often paid less than men, for the same work. Available data on rural and agricultural feminization shows that this is not a general trend but mainly a sub-Saharan Africa phenomena, as well as observed in some sectors such as unskilled labour in the fruit, vegetable and cut-flower export sector. This paper re-affirms that women make essential contributions to agriculture and rural enterprises across the developing world. But there is much diversity in women's roles and over-generalization undermines policy relevance and planning. The context is important and policies must be based on sound data and gender analysis.},

abstract = {Background The regression discontinuity design (RDD) is a quasi-experimental approach used to avoid confounding bias in the assessment of new policies and interventions. It is applied specifically in situations where individuals are assigned to a policy/intervention based on whether they are above or below a pre-specified cut-off on a continuously measured variable, such as birth date, income or weight. The strength of the design is that, provided individuals do not manipulate the value of this variable, assignment to the policy/intervention is considered as good as random for individuals close to the cut-off. Despite its popularity in fields like economics, the RDD remains relatively unknown in epidemiology where its application could be tremendously useful. Methods In this paper, we provide a practical introduction to the RDD for health researchers, describe four empirically testable assumptions of the design and offer strategies that can be used to assess whether these assumptions are met in a given study. For illustrative purposes, we implement these strategies to assess whether the RDD is appropriate for a study of the impact of human papillomavirus vaccination on cervical dysplasia. Results We found that, whereas the assumptions of the RDD were generally satisfied in our study context, birth timing had the potential to confound our effect estimate in an unexpected way and therefore needed to be taken into account in the analysis. Conclusions Our findings underscore the importance of assessing the validity of the assumptions of this design, testing them when possible and making adjustments as necessary to support valid causal inference.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2017. Loss to follow-up is an endemic feature of time-to-event analyses that precludes observation of the event of interest. To our knowledge, in typical cohort studies with encounters occurring at regular or irregular intervals, there is no consensus on how to handle person-time between participants' last study encounter and the point at which they meet a definition of loss to follow-up. We demonstrate, using simulation and an example, that when the event of interest is captured outside of a study encounter (e.g., in a registry), person-time should be censored when the study-defined criterion for loss to follow-up is met (e.g., 1 year after last encounter), rather than at the last study encounter. Conversely, when the event of interest must be measured within the context of a study encounter (e.g., a biomarker value), person-time should be censored at the last study encounter. An inappropriate censoring scheme has the potential to result in substantial bias that may not be easily corrected.},

abstract = {IMPORTANCE Patients with cancer who use statins appear to have a substantially better survival than nonusers in observational studies. However, this inverse association between statin use and mortalitymay be due to selection bias and immortal-time bias. OBJECTIVE To emulate a randomized trial of statin therapy initiation that is free of selection bias and immortal-time bias. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS We used observational data on 17 372 patients with cancer from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database (2007-2009) with complete follow-up until 2011. The SEER-Medicare database links 17 US cancer registries and claims files from Medicare and Medicaid in 12 US states.We included individuals with a new diagnosis of colorectal, breast, prostate, or bladder cancer who had not been prescribed statins for at least 6 months before the cancer diagnosis. Individuals were duplicated, and each replicate was assigned to either the strategy "statin therapy initiation within 6 months after diagnosis" or "no statin therapy initiation." Replicates were censored when they stopped following their assigned strategy, and the potential selection bias was adjusted for via inverse-probability weighting. Hazard ratios (HRs), cumulative incidences, and risk differences were calculated for all-cause mortality and cancer-specific mortality.We then compared our estimates with those obtained using the same analytic approaches used in previous observational studies. EXPOSURES Statin therapy initiation within 6 months after cancer diagnosis. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Cancer-specific and all-cause mortality using SEER-Medicare data and data from previous studies. RESULTS Of the 17 372 patients whose data were analyzed, 8440 (49{\%}) were men, and 8932 (51{\%}) were women (mean [SD] age, 76.4 [7.4] years; range, 66-115 years). The adjusted HR (95{\%}CI) comparing statin therapy initiation vs no initiation was 1.00 (0.88-1.15) for cancer-specific mortality and 1.07 (0.93-1.21) for overall mortality. Cumulative incidence curves for both groups were almost overlapping (the risk difference never exceeded 0.8{\%}). In contrast, the methods used by prior studies resulted in an inverse association between statin use and mortality (pooled hazard ratio 0.69). CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE After usingmethods that are not susceptible to selection bias from prevalent users and to immortal time bias, we found that initiation of therapy with statins within 6 months after cancer diagnosis did not appear to improve 3-year cancer-specific or overall survival.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: To date, a counterfactual framework has not been used to study determinants of social inequalities in cancer. Considering the case of colorectal cancer, for which racial/ethnic differences in stage at diagnosis and survival are well documented, we quantify the extent to which black versus white survival disparities would be reduced had disparities in stage at diagnosis been eliminated in a large patient population. METHODS: We obtained data on colorectal cancer patients (diagnosed between 1992 and 2005 and followed until 2010) from US-SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results) cancer registries. We employed a counterfactual approach to estimate the mean survival time up to the 60th month since diagnosis for black colorectal cancer patients had black-white disparities in stage at diagnosis been eliminated. RESULTS: Black patients survive approximately 4.0 [confidence interval (CI), 4.6-3.2] months less than white patients within five years since diagnosis. Had disparities in stage at diagnosis been eliminated, survival disparities decrease to 2.6 (CI, 3.4-1.7) months, an approximately 35{\%} reduction. For patients diagnosed after the age of 65 years, disparities would be halved, while reduction of approximately 30{\%} is estimated for younger patients. Survival disparities would be reduced by approximately 44{\%} for women and approximately 26{\%} for men. CONCLUSIONS: Employing a counterfactual approach and allowing for heterogeneities in black-white disparities across patients' characteristics, we give robust evidence that elimination of disparities in stage at diagnosis contributes to a substantial reduction in survival disparities in colorectal cancer. IMPACT: We provide the first evidence in the SEER population that elimination of inequities in stage at diagnosis might lead to larger reductions in survival disparities among elderly and women.

abstract = {Birth weight is the single most significant determinant of infant mortality and the chances of a newborn to experience healthy development. Low birth weight also appears to be related to higher risks of several im- portant chronic conditions, such as ischemic heart disease, non-insulin- dependent diabetes, and cancer in adults. Thus factors that influence in utero growth and birth weight may have a serious effect on health outcomes many years later in life. Analysis of seasonal variations in birth weights may en- able us to suggest specific factors that influence this measure. In this review we summarize the literature on seasonal variations in birth weight. Although causes of seasonal variation in developing regions are more clearly under- stood, it is not yet clear which factors affect apparent seasonal variation in birth weight in developed countries. In our analysis we observed a pattern of seasonal variations in developed countries that differed between low-, middle-, and high-latitude countries, and we suggest several mechanisms that may be responsible for this diversity. Namely, we suggest that in middle- latitude climates, the large annual temperature range may cause low birth weights during summer, whereas in high- and low-latitude regions variations in sunlight exposure between seasons may contribute to low birth weights apparent during winter. Identification of the suggested causal environmental factors may have public health implications in the development of primary prevention programs for low birth weight and macrosomia in developed countries.},

abstract = {Recently, it has been shown how to estimate model-adjusted risks, risk differences, and risk ratios from complex survey data based on risk averaging and SUDAAN (Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina). The authors present an alternative approach based on marginal structural models (MSMs) and SAS (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, North Carolina). The authors estimate the parameters of the MSM using inverse weights that are the product of 2 terms. The first term is a survey weight that adjusts the sample to represent the unstandardized population. The second term is an inverse-probability-of-exposure weight that standardizes the population in order to adjust for confounding; it must be estimated using the survey weights. The authors show how to use the MSM parameter estimates and contrasts to test and estimate effect-measure modification; SAS code is provided. They also explain how to program the previous risk-averaging approach in SAS. The 2 methods are applied and compared using data from the 2007 Florida Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System Survey to assess effect modification by age of the difference in risk of cost barriers to health care between persons with disability and persons without disability. {\textcopyright} The Author 2010.},

In addition, the socio-economic level of the mother and the maternal health status (HIV/AIDS, malaria, nutrition) has an impact on the survival of the child. Thus the primary purpose of “One Integrated Maternal Newborn and Child Health Strategic Plan” is to ensure improved coordination of interventions and delivery of services across the continuum of care. Another purpose of the document is to guide implementation across operational levels of the system so that policy drawn at national level will be carried out at the district and community levels, with support from the regional level.

abstract = {Although understanding the role of race, ethnicity, and identity is central to political science, methodological debates persist about whether it is possible to estimate the effect of something immutable. At the heart of the debate is an older theoretical question: Is race best understood under an essentialist or constructivist framework? In contrast to the “immutable characteristics” or essentialist approach, we argue that race should be operationalized as a “bundle of sticks” that can be disaggregated into elements. With elements of race, causal claims may be possible using two designs: (a) studies that measure the effect of exposure to a racial cue and (b) studies that exploit within-group variation to measure the effect of some manipulable element. These designs can reconcile scholarship on race and causation and offer a clear framework for future research.},

abstract = {The simcausal R package is a tool for specification and simulation of complex longitudinal data structures that are based on non-parametric structural equation models. The package aims to provide a flexible tool for simplifying the conduct of transparent and reproducible simulation studies, with a particular emphasis on the types of data and interventions frequently encountered in real-world causal inference problems, such as, observational data with time-dependent confounding, selection bias, and random monitoring processes. The package interface allows for concise expression of complex functional dependencies between a large number of nodes, where each node may represent a measurement at a specific time point. The package allows for specification and simulation of counterfactual data under various user-specified interventions (e.g., static, dynamic, deterministic, or stochastic). In particular, the interventions may represent exposures to treatment regimens, the occurrence or non-occurrence of right-censoring events, or of clinical monitoring events. Finally, the package enables the computation of a selected set of user-specified features of the distribution of the counterfactual data that represent common causal quantities of interest, such as, treatment-specific means, the average treatment effects and coefficients from working marginal structural models. The applicability of simcausal is demonstrated by replicating the results of two published simulation studies.},

"The consequences of any experience that children from a particular ethnic group have in their own home environments depends on the history of intergroup relations in that group's current societal context and the gress of connectedness between family life and other societal institutions designed to support child well-being."
"Thus, there is reason to suspect that certain aspects of the home environment may be less strongly associated with child behavior and development in older children"
"estimates of the heritability of many characteristics increase with age, suggestive of more active selection of environments deemed desirable by children as they grow older."
"Relatedly, Scarr (1992) and others (eg Rowe, Jacobson, Van den Oord 1999) have arged that environmental influences are greatest in conditions that pose a risk or hazard for development."
"Rowe and colleagues (1999) recently found that environmental conditions shared by members of the same family had greater influence in families in which mothers had low educational attainment as compared with families in which mothers had high educational attainment."

"The HLM analyses revealed a complicated set of relations between HOME-SF scores and children's behavior problems"
"Overall, fewer behavior problems were observed among children from families with more positive HOME-SF Scale scores, especially when children were older. The patter of association varied as a function of both ethnicity and poverty status, however."
"Pairwise comparisons indicated that associations between learning stimulation and the BPI were stronger among European American children... than among African American children"
"The fact that learning stimulation in this study was associated with children's behavior problems in every ethnic group from early childhood through adolescence, despite controlling for family demographics, parental responsiveness, and the level of spanking, suggests that theories about the causes and maintenance of behavior problems may need to be expanded to consider the roles played by the object environment and direct efforts of parents to provide learning opportunities for their children."
"Other researchers have also observed that the relation between harsh parenting and behavior problems increases with age (Pettit et al., 1997)"},

@article{OLeary2012a,
abstract = {ISSUES: The lack of consensus about whether low to moderate levels of prenatal alcohol exposure are a risk factor for fetal development has generated considerable debate about what advice policies and guidelines should provide. APPROACH: This paper reviews the evidence from systematic reviews and meta-analyses examining the risk from low and moderate levels of prenatal alcohol exposure, along with the results of articles published 2009-2010, after the reviews. KEY FINDINGS: The reported significant effects from low levels of prenatal alcohol exposure are likely due to methodological issues such as confounding and/or misclassification of exposure or outcome and there is no strong research evidence of fetal effects from low levels of alcohol exposure. However, harm is well-documented with heavy exposure and moderate levels of exposure, 30-40 g per occasion and no more than 70 g per week, have been demonstrated to increase the risk of child behaviour problems. IMPLICATIONS: With such a small margin before there is increased risk to the fetus, it would be morally and ethically unacceptable for policies and guidelines to condone consumption of alcohol during pregnancy. Not all women will follow this advice and some women will inadvertently consume alcohol prior to pregnancy awareness requiring non-judgmental counselling and the provision of rational advice about the likelihood of risk to the fetus. CONCLUSIONS: The policy advice that 'the safest choice for pregnant women is to abstain from alcohol during pregnancy' should be maintained. However, the abstinence message needs to be presented in a balanced and rational manner to prevent unintended negative consequences.},

The current study examined discrepancies between mothers' and children's reports of child emotion regulation. This investigation examined patterns of discrepancies for key aspects of emotion regulation (i.e., inhibition and dysregulated expression) and for three emotions (anger, sadness, worry). A total of 61 mother-child dyads (mean children's age = 9.3 years) participated. As hypothesized, discrepancies for inhibition subscales were of a larger magnitude than those for dysregulated expression subscales. Furthermore, age was related to discrepancies in both anger subscales, parent reports of child externalizing symptoms were related to anger dysregulated expression discrepancies, and child reports of internalizing symptoms were related to sadness dysregulated expression discrepancies. Overall, the findings suggest that patterns of discrepant reports are not random but rather may provide meaningful and useful information about the nature of emotion regulation. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Gastroschisis, a birth defect characterized by herniated fetal abdominal wall, occurs more commonly in infants born to teenage and young mothers. Ischemia of the vascular vitelline vessels is the likely mechanism of pathogenesis. Given that chronic stress and violence against women are risk factors for cardiovascular disease we explored whether these may represent risk factors for gastroschisis, when they occur during pregnancy. A case-control study was conducted, with 15 incident cases of children born with gastroschisis in the Region of Murcia, Spain, from December 2007 to June 2013. Forty concurrent controls were recruited at gestation weeks 20-24 or post-partum. All mothers of cases and controls completed a comprehensive, in-person, 'green sheet' questionnaire on environmental exposures. RESULTS: Mothers of children with gastroschisis were younger, smoked more cigarettes per week relative to controls, were exposed to higher amounts of illegal drugs, and suffered from domestic violence more frequently than the controls. Multivariable logistic regression analysis highlights periconceptional 'gender-related violence' (OR: 16.6, 95{\%} CI 2.7 to 101.7) and younger maternal age (OR 1.1, 95{\%} CI 1.0-1.3). CONCLUSIONS: Violence against pregnant women is associated with birth defects, and should be studied in more depth as a cause-effect teratogenic. Psychosocial risk factors, including gender-based violence, are important for insuring the health and safety of the pregnant mother and the fetus.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Recent oral contraceptive (OC) use has been consistently associated with increased risk of breast cancer, but evidence on specific breast cancer subtypes is sparse. METHODS: We investigated recency and duration of OC use in relation to molecular subtypes of breast cancer in a pooled analysis of data from the African American Breast Cancer Epidemiology and Risk Consortium. The study included 1,848 women with estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer, 1,043 with ER-negative (ER-) breast cancer (including 494 triple negative (TN) tumors, which do not have receptors for estrogen, progesterone, and human epidermal growth factor 2), and 10,044 controls. Multivariable polytomous logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95{\%} confidence intervals (CIs) for exposure categories relative to never use, controlling for potential confounding variables. RESULTS: OC use within the previous 5 years was associated with increased risk of ER+ (OR 1.46, 95{\%} CI 1.18 to 1.81), ER- (OR 1.57, 95{\%} CI 1.22 to 1.43), and TN (OR 1.78, 95{\%} CI 1.25 to 2.53) breast cancer. The risk declined after cessation of use but was apparent for ER+ cancer for 15 to 19 years after cessation and for ER- breast cancer for an even longer interval after cessation. Long duration of use was also associated with increased risk of each subtype, particularly ER-. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that OC use, particularly recent use of long duration, is associated with an increased risk of ER+, ER-, and TN breast cancer in African American women. Research into mechanisms that explain these findings, especially the association with ER- breast cancer, is needed.},

Prentice (Biometrika 1986;73:1-11) showed how the case-cohort design can be used to obtain relative risk estimates for comparisons within the cohort being studied. In this paper, the authors consider ways in which the case-cohort design can be used for comparing risk in exposure groups within the cohort to the risk in an external population. The problem reduces to estimating the number of expected cases at each exposure level in the total cohort, when exposure status is available only for members of a subcohort, i.e., a random sample of the total cohort. The authors describe theoretical and empirical properties of several variations of the design and analysis of case-cohort studies. Empirical properties were examined by replicating the selection of the subcohort in a study of second cancer risk after chemotherapy for a first cancer. Use of a case-cohort design in that study would have saved five-sixths of the cost of gathering covariate information at the price of only an 11{\%} loss in efficiency relative to a full cohort study.},

However, little work has been done to quantify the bias caused by this type of unmeasured confounding and determine whether this bias will materially affect conclusions regarding mediation. The author developed a sensitivity analysis program to address this crucial issue. Data from 2 well-known studies in the methodological literature on mediation were reanalyzed using this program. The results of mediation analyses were found not to be as vulnerable to the impact of confounding as previously described; however, these findings varied sharply between the 2 studies. Although the indirect effect observed in one study could potentially be due to a cause common to both the mediator and the outcome, such confounding could not feasibly explain the results of the other study. These disparate results demonstrate the utility of the current sensitivity analysis when assessing mediation.},

abstract = {Prenatal diagnostic technology makes it possible to offer women the option of electively terminating pregnancies affected by birth defects. Excluding these pregnancies from epidemiologic studies may affect study results. We explored this effect using examples from the literature. We calculated the bias in the odds ratio caused by excluding prenatally diagnosed pregnancies when the exposure of interest is not correlated with the likelihood of terminating an affected pregnancy and when it is correlated with an increase or decrease in this likelihood. We assumed that control infants did not have birth defects. When the exposure is not associated with the likelihood of a pregnancy termination, studies excluding terminations suffer a loss of precision. When the exposure is associated with an increase or decrease in this likelihood, the odds ratios are biased toward or away from the null, respectively. The magnitude of the bias will vary according to characteristics of the study population such as the prevalence of the exposure and the frequency with which prenatal diagnosis and elective termination are used. Whenever possible, pregnancies terminated after prenatal diagnosis must be included in epidemiologic studies.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To assist in elucidating principles underlying the design of injury case-control studies.APPROACH: We begin by defining "event" as the sequence of circumstances that place a person at risk of injury (e.g. bicycle crash) and "injury given the event" as the resultant physical damage (e.g. head injury in bicycle crash). We then identify two broad classes of research question: 1) Studies of risk factors for the event, and, 2) Studies of risk factors for injury given the event. The study base for the first type of research question is all persons at risk of the event, while the study base for the second type is all persons who experience the event, and are therefore at risk of injury. It follows that in studies of risk factors for injury given the event, the controls should be a sample of all persons who experience the event. For example, in a study of bicycle helmets and head injuries, a suitable case group would be cyclists treated for head injury following a bicycle crash. The appropriate control group is drawn from the base population of all cyclists who crashed, including those who had no injuries. The control group may be restricted to cyclists who crashed and sought treatment for non-head injury under the assumption that the exposure distribution (prevalence of cycle helmet use) in the crash/no injury group is identical to the exposure distribution in the crash/non-head injury group.CONCLUSIONS: It is over ten years since innovative researchers in Seattle first applied the case-control design to the problem of bicycle crashes. Since then, successive bicycle injury studies at other centers have largely failed to extend and refine the Seattle methodology. A more critical approach to the design of case-control studies is required if we are to continue to advance the field of injury epidemiology.},

Directed acyclic graphs clarify the causal relationships necessary for a particular variable to serve as an effect modifier for the causal risk difference involving 2 other variables. The directed acyclic graph causal framework thereby gives rise to a 4-fold classification for effect modification: direct effect modification, indirect effect modification, effect modification by proxy and effect modification by a common cause. We briefly discuss the case of multiple effect modification relationships and multiple effect modifiers as well as measures of effect other than that of the causal risk difference.},

abstract = {Causal effects are defined as comparisons of potential outcomes under different treatments on a common set of units. Observed values of the potential outcomes are revealed by the assignment mechanism—a probabilistic model for the treatment each unit receives as a function of covariates and potential outcomes. Fisher made tremendous contributions to causal inference through his work on the design of randomized experiments, but the potential outcomes perspective applies to other complex experiments and nonrandomized studies as well. As noted by Kempthorne in his 1976 discussion of Savage's Fisher lecture, Fisher never bridged his work on experimental design and his work on parametric modeling, a bridge that appears nearly automatic with an appropriate view of the potential outcomes framework, where the potential outcomes and covariates are given a Bayesian distribution to complete the model specification.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To compare 4-year IQ of normally grown term infants born to women with gestational weight gain under, at, and over the recommendations of the 2009 Institute of Medicine (IOM) guidelines. STUDY DESIGN: We used data from the US Collaborative Perinatal Project (1959-66), a multicenter, prospective cohort of almost 60,000 pregnancies. Analysis was restricted to live-born term singletons with birthweights 2500-4200g. Major congenital anomalies and neonatal morbidities, genetic syndromes, newborn endocrine disorders, parental intellectual disability, maternal substance abuse, and maternal thyroid disorders were excluded. Using pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI, kg/m2), subjects were grouped according to the 2009 IOM classification of underweight ({\textless}18.5), normal weight (18.5-24.9), overweight (25-29.9), and obese ({\textgreater}30). Gestational weight gain was categorized according to pre-pregnancy BMI and IOM guidelines: Under Goal, At Goal, and Over Goal. Within each BMI group, offspring Stanford-Binet IQ at age 4 was compared between weight gain groups using At Goal weight gain as the reference. Analyses were adjusted for smoking, breastfeeding, socioeconomic index, income, race and maternal education. RESULTS: Mean offspring IQ of normal weight women (98.9+/-16.4) was significantly higher than underweight (97.2+/-15.6), overweight (95.8+/-15), and obese (95.5+/-14.9) women (P{\textless}0.0001). In all BMI groups, except underweight, there was a decrease in offspring IQ with inappropriate weight gain(Table 1). Adjusted analysis showed a significant decrease in offspring IQ with Over Goal weight gain in the normal and overweight groups, whereas Under Goal weight gain among obese women resulted in a higher offspring IQ(Fig 1). Gestational weight gain still did not affect 4 year IQ among underweight women. CONCLUSION: In this historical cohort, excessive gestational weight gain in normal, overweight, and obese women had an adverse impact on offspring IQ at age 4. Further research with a contemporary cohort is needed to validate these findings. (Figure presented).},

abstract = {Delivery records from hospitals in Ikwiriri and Ifakara show that the number of births increases throughout the dry season (June-October) and declines throughout the rainy season (November), reaching a peak just before the rains and the lowest level at the end of the rainy season. This pattern does not correspond with the usual explanations of birth seasonality. Conceptions are most frequent at the period of highest temperature, which is contrary to the theory that predicts them to be more frequent during the dry season. The drop of the conception rate during the wet agricultural season suggests that stress on women may be the main cause of birth seasonality in Tanzania. Due to wet conditions and frequent staying on in the rice fields, exposure to malaria increases during the rainy season's latter part. The negative association of the number of births with rainfall in the months preceding conception indicates that almost half of the variation in the number of births may be due to the effects of malaria and physical exhaustion on fecundity. The remainder may be    attributable to seasonal variations in pregnancy loss and sexual behavior. The absence of strong birth seasonality in nonholoendemic areas of Tanzania and the low birth rate in holoendemic areas provide further support for a critical role for malaria infection. The fact that the magnitude of seasonal variation in births increases with high parity and has decreased over the past decade results from recent changes in Tanzania's rural economy. Young people in Tanzania are progressively withdrawing from agriculture, especially when they have no children yet.},

abstract = {Several recent studies have demonstrated the importance of incorporating qualitative differentiation within educational systems in the study of class inequality in student transitions. We extend these endeavors by broadening the definition of differentiation to include participation in the labor market. As increasing proportions of students continue their educational journeys beyond compulsory schooling, they are considering not only whether to stay in school but also whether to simultaneously enter the world of work. Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth of 1997 (NLSY97), we show that family background influences not only whether students make specific educational transitions but also whether they combine those educational transitions with work. Student trajectories are also path dependent, with employment during one educational transition being related to specific transition patterns at a later point in time. Considering how students combine school and work reveals another dimension of differentiation which can be exploited by socioeconomically advantaged families to "effectively maintain" inequality in educational outcomes. ?? 2009 International Sociological Association Research Committee 28 on Social Stratification and Mobility.},

Method comparison studies revealed large differences for some individual samples. Overall slopes ranged from 0.50 to 1.48, and correlation coefficients were 0.90 to 0.96 when the ADVIA Centaur was the comparison method. The 97.5 percentile upper reference limit ranged from 23.3 to 51.7 kU/L. Additional standardization efforts are needed, and the availability of reference material is required.

METHODS: A sub-cohort of 2179 healthy Chinese adolescents randomly selected from schools in Wuhan, China, including 1156 boys and 1023 girls 11 to 15 years of age was included in the current study. Weight, height, self-perceptions of weight status, depressive psychological symptoms including anxiety, depression, perceived peer isolation, and other constructs were measured by a structured questionnaire. A General Linear Model was used to compare psychological differences between actual and perceived weight groups. RESULTS: Perceived underweight was more likely to occur in boys, whereas perceived overweight was more likely to occur in girls. Compared with objective body weight status defined by the International Obesity Task Force (IOTF) and the World Health Organization (WHO) age- and gender-specific body mass index (BMI) cutoffs, girls were more likely to misperceive themselves as overweight, whereas relatively more boys misclassified their weight status as underweight. After adjusting for age, parents' educational attainment, and urban residence, perceived overweight boys and girls were more likely to experience anxiety and depression than perceived normal and underweight subjects (p {\textless}.05). Perceived overweight girls and perceived underweight boys experienced higher peer isolation than other groups (p {\textless}.05). Significant differences were not found in social support, school connectedness, trouble with teachers, and family disharmony among different weight-perception groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggested distortion of weight perception was prevalent, and may have detrimental psychological influences in Chinese adolescents},

abstract = {Study Objectives: We sought to determine whether selected periconceptional health behaviors that influence risk for birth defects differ between older and younger adolescents and whether pregnancy intention predicts more positive preconception health behaviors among teens. Design and Participants: We analyzed interview responses from 954 adolescent control group participants from the National Birth Defects Prevention Study who delivered live infants during 1997-2007. Main Outcome Measures: Adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95{\%} confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for factors of interest by age categories (13-15, 16-17, and 18 years, relative to 19 years). To construct a composite periconceptional behavior index, we summed the following healthy behaviors: nonsmoker, nondrinker, folic acid supplementation, and eating 5 or more servings of fruits and vegetables per day. Results: Analyses indicated that women in the youngest group (13-15 years of age) were more likely to be Hispanic (aOR 2.83, 95{\%} CI 1.40-5.70) and less likely to engage in some unhealthy pregnancy-related behaviors compared with 19-year-olds, such as smoking (aOR 0.45, 95{\%} CI 0.20-0.99) and being overweight or obese (aOR 0.32, 95{\%} CI 0.16-0.61). However, they were also less likely to have taken periconceptional folic acid (aOR 0.44, 95{\%} CI 0.21-0.90). About one-third of teen mothers indicated that their pregnancies had been intended. Among 18- and 19-year-olds, this predicted a higher mean value for the composite periconceptional behavior index (2.30 versus 1.94, P ≤ .01). Conclusions: Teen mothers are not a homogeneous group. Each age subgroup presents varied demographic and behavioral factors that put them at varying levels of risk for birth defects. Furthermore, caregivers should not assume that teens do not plan pregnancies or that they need not be informed of the importance of periconceptional health.},

Simulation studies on the influence of outliers by considering contaminated data under four perturbation patterns to generate outliers were carried out and confirm that the Beta rectangular regression model seems to be a new robust alternative for modeling proportion data and that the Beta regression model shows sensitivity to the estimation of regression coefficients, to the posterior distribution of all parameters and to the model comparison criteria considered. Furthermore, two applications are presented to illustrate the robustness of the Beta rectangular model.},

abstract = {Purpose: To examine the relationship between body mass index (BMI), body weight perception (BWP), and indicators of internalizing and externalizing distress and social, attention and thought problems in a large representative sample of Dutch youth. Methods: A total of 1826 pupils in the eighth grade of primary education and 5730 students in the first four years of secondary education gave their height and weight to obtain an estimate of their BMI. They reported their evaluation of their body weight and completed Achenbach's Youth Self-Report (YSR) (1991), which assesses eight types of problem behavior. Data were analyzed in a multivariate framework with BMI and BWP as predictors and the YSR scores on different kinds of problem behavior as dependent variables, controlling for background characteristics. Results: Both BMI and BWP are associated with internalizing and externalizing problem behavior, and social, attention and thought problems. Multivariate tests show that BWP is more closely linked to problem behavior than BMI. Adolescents who were either underweight or overweight but considered themselves in good shape had no more problems than the group with normal BMI and BWP 'good'. The perception of being 'too thin' and particularly the perception of being 'too heavy' best predict problem behavior in both male and female adolescents. Overweight youngsters with an adequate perception of their weight have less somatic complaints than their normal-weight peers who perceive themselves as too heavy, but they show higher withdrawnness, social problems, and anxiety/depression. Conclusions: Adolescent girls are more dissatisfied with their weight than boys; however, the relationship between weight perception and problem behavior is the same for both genders. ?? 2006 Society for Adolescent Medicine.},

An important contribution of our study is the use of information on siblings to control for unmeasured factors that may confound estimates of the effect of pregnancy intentions on infant and child outcomes. Results from our study indicate that unwanted pregnancy is associated with prenatal and postpartum maternal behaviors that adversely affect infant and child health, but that unwanted pregnancy has little association with birth weight and child cognitive outcomes. Estimates of the association between unwanted pregnancy and maternal behaviors were greatly reduced after controls for unmeasured family background were included in the model. Our results also indicate that there are no significant differences in maternal behaviors or child outcomes between mistimed and wanted pregnancies.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To deal with the causal relationship between corporal punishment and antisocial behavior (ASB) by considering the level of ASB of the child at the start of the study. METHODS: Data from interviews with a national sample of 807 mothers of children aged 6 to 9 years in the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth-Child Supplement. Analysis of variance was used to test the hypothesis that when parents use corporal punishment to correct ASB, it increases subsequent ASB. The analysis controlled for the level of ASB at the start of the study, family socio-economic status, sex of the child, and the extent to which the home provided emotional support and cognitive stimulation. RESULTS: Forty-four percent of the mothers reported spanking their children during the week prior to the study and they spanked them an average of 2.1 times that week. The more spanking at the start of the period, the higher the level of ASB 2 years later. The change is unlikely to be owing to the child's tendency toward ASB or to confounding with demographic characteristics or with parental deficiency in other key aspects of socialization because those variables were statistically controlled. CONCLUSIONS: When parents use corporal punishment to reduce ASB, the long-term effect tends to be the opposite. The findings suggest that if parents replace corporal punishment by nonviolent modes of discipline, it could reduce the risk of ASB among children and reduce the level of violence in American society.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate weight perception, dieting and emotional well being across the range of body mass index (BMI) in a population-based multiethnic sample of early adolescents. DESIGN: Cross-sectional population-based survey. SUBJECTS: In total, 2789 adolescents 11-14 years of age from three highly deprived regional authorities in East London, in 2001. MEASUREMENTS: Data were collected by student-completed questionnaire on weight perception, dieting history, mental and physical health, health behaviours, social capital and sociodemographic factors. Height and weight were measured by trained researchers. Overweight was defined as BMI {\textgreater} or =85th centile and obesity as BMI {\textgreater} or =98th centile. Underweight was defined as BMI{\textless} or =15th centile. RESULTS: In all, 73{\%} were from ethnic groups other than white British. Valid BMI were available for 2522 subjects (90.4{\%}) of whom 14{\%} were obese. Only 20{\%} of overweight boys and 51{\%} of overweight girls assessed their weight accurately. Accuracy of weight perception did not vary between ethnic groups. In all, 42{\%} of girls and 26{\%} of boys reported current dieting to lose weight. Compared with white British teenagers, a history of dieting was more common among Bangladeshi, Indian and mixed ethnicity boys and less likely among Pakistani girls. Self-esteem was not associated with BMI in girls but was significantly lower in obese boys than those of normal weight (P=0.02). Within ethnic subgroups, self-esteem was significantly lower in overweight white British boys (P=0.03) and obese Bangladeshi boys (P=0.01) and Bangladeshi girls (P=0.04), but significantly higher in obese black African girls (P=0.01) than those of normal weight. Obese young people had a higher prevalence of psychological distress (P=0.04), except among Bangladeshi teenagers, where overweight and obese young people had less psychological distress than those of normal weight (P=0.02). Birth outside the UK was associated with reduced risk of obesity in girls (P=0.02) but not with history of dieting, weight perception or psychological factors in either gender. CONCLUSION: High levels of current dieting for weight control and inaccurate perception of body mass are common across all ethnic groups. However, dieting history and the associations of obesity with self-esteem and psychological distress vary between ethnic groups. Interventions to prevent or treat obesity in black or minority ethnicity groups must consider cultural differences in the relationship between body mass, self-esteem and psychological distress.},

abstract = {Case histories are presented of 8 unrelated children born to mothers who were chronic alcoholics.  These children showed a similar pattern of craniofacial, limb, and cardiovascular defects associated with prenatal-onset growth deficiency and developmental delay.  This is the 1st report to document an association between maternal alcoholism and aberrant morphogenesis in the offspring.  The mean duration of maternal alcoholism was 9.4 years.  3 of the cases were black, 3 were Native American, and 2 were white.  The mean gestational age was 38 weeks.  The degree of linear growth deficiency was more severe than the deficit of weight at birth, suggesting that a factor other than maternal undernutrition alone affected prenatal growth.  Developmental delay, prenatal and postnatal growth deficiency, and short palbebral fissures were observed in all 8 children.  7 of the 8 children also demonstrated microcephaly and maxillary hypoplasia with relative prognathism.  6 had an altered palmar crease pattern, 5 showed cardiac and joint anomalies, and 4 had epicanthal folds.  Although adequate nutrition was provided to the children during hospital admission and/or foster care placement, no catch-up growth was observed.  After 1 year, the average linear growth rate was 65{\%} of normal and the average rate of weight gain was only 38{\%} of normal.  By 1 year, head circumference fell below the 3rd percentile for height and chronological age in 5 of the 6 children in whom measurements were taken.  Fine motor dysfunction was present in 5 of the 6 children tested, and most were delayed in gross motor performance as well.  The similarity in pattern of malformation noted among these 8 children suggests a singular mode of etiology related to an as yet unknown effect of maternal alcoholism.  Direct ethanol toxicity is the most likely possibility.},

Am J Epidemiol 1992;135:1029-50). In this paper, a theoretical framework for selecting controls in case-control studies is developed. Three principles of comparability are described: 1) study base, that all comparisons be made within the study base; 2) deconfounding, that comparisons of the effects of the levels of exposure on disease risk not be distorted by the effects of other factors; and 3) comparable accuracy, that any errors in measurement of exposure be nondifferential between cases and controls. These principles, if adhered to in a study, can reduce selection, confounding, and information bias, respectively. The principles, however, are constrained by an additional efficiency principle regarding resources and time. Most problems and controversies in control selection reflect trade-offs among these four principles.},

abstract = {The proportion of child deaths that occurs in the neonatal period (38{\%} in 2000) is increasing, and the Millennium Development Goal for child survival cannot be met without substantial reductions in neonatal mortality. Every year an estimated 4 million babies die in the first 4 weeks of life (the neonatal period). A similar number are stillborn, and 0.5 million mothers die from pregnancy-related causes. Three-quarters of neonatal deaths happen in the first week - the highest risk of death is on the first day of life. Almost all (99{\%}) neonatal deaths arise in low-income and middle-income countries, yet most epidemiological and other research focuses on the 1{\%} of deaths in rich countries. The highest numbers of neonatal deaths are in south-central Asian countries and the highest rates are generally in sub-Saharan Africa. The countries in these regions (with some exceptions) have made little progress in reducing such deaths in the past 10-15 years. Globally, the main direct causes of neonatal death are estimated to be preterm birth (28{\%}), severe infections (26{\%}), and asphyxia (23{\%}). Neonatal tetanus accounts for a smaller proportion of deaths (7{\%}), but is easily preventable. Low birthweight is an important indirect cause of death. Maternal complications in labour carry a high risk of neonatal death, and poverty is strongly associated with an increased risk. Preventing deaths in newborn babies has not been a focus of child survival or safe motherhood programmes. While we neglect these challenges, 450 newborn children die every hour, mainly from preventable causes, which is unconscionable in the 21st century.},

We conducted a linear regression analysis of the weight with month and year of birth, sex, maternal age, diabetes, and several meteorological factors as independent variables, which were also incorporated into multivariate logistic regression models to examine the effect of season of birth on the frequency of low birth weight (LBW, {\textless}2500 g) or macrosomia ({\textgreater}4000 g).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: A significant (P {\textless} .001) seasonal pattern in birth weights was observed, with a peak in July and a trough in January. Babies born in summer had an OR of 1.12 (95{\%} CI; 1.07 to 1.18) for macrosomia compared with those born in the winter. No such pattern was found for LBW.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: While in regions of mid-latitude, summer is associated with relatively lower birth weight, possibly because of exposure to cold temperature during early or mid-pregnancy, our data suggest that in Israel, the peak birth weight is in summer, possibly because of increased exposure to sunlight in the last weeks of the pregnancy.},
